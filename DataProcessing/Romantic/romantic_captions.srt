FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS14
00:04:13,00 --> 00:04:20,50
His date gives a thumbs up, mouths SOMEONE Mayer, and rushes inside. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS15
00:04:19,00 --> 00:04:23,50
SOMEONE's date hugs her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS16
00:04:23,00 --> 00:04:29,50
A Castle Rock Entertainment Production. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS17
00:04:48,00 --> 00:04:58,50
Behind SOMEONE and her friend a flyer reads Friends with Benefits. Now the web designer rides in an airplane. A flight attendant 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS18
00:04:55,00 --> 00:05:00,50
flirtatiously close. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS19
00:05:16,00 --> 00:05:21,50
She jerks his seat up and turns away. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS20
00:05:22,00 --> 00:05:28,50
In a hired car, SOMEONE uses her cell. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS21
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:33,50
She changes clothes. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS22
00:05:44,00 --> 00:05:50,50
As the driver eyes the building, she changes her top. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS23
00:05:52,00 --> 00:05:59,50
Now at the airport, she approaches a driver holding a name card. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS24
00:06:03,00 --> 00:06:17,50
She takes the card and writes SOMEONE on the back with lipstick. As the web designer walks through a sliding door, an air gust blows the sign from her hands. It lands on a baggage carousel. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS25
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:20,50
She chases after it. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS26
00:06:19,00 --> 00:06:26,50
She removes her shoes, climbs up on the conveyer, and runs past suitcases. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS27
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:33,50
SOMEONE notices her handing a man a suitcase. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS28
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:39,50
She trots down to the other end of the carousel, hopping over bags. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS29
00:06:37,00 --> 00:06:42,50
She and SOMEONE both reach for her sign. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS30
00:07:28,00 --> 00:07:33,50
Now they sit in the car. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS32
00:08:58,00 --> 00:09:11,50
He hands her an iced green tea beverage and goes inside. SOMEONE takes a sip, then spits it out. Rinsing her mouth with water, she spits again, nearly hitting a passerby. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS33
00:09:10,00 --> 00:09:22,50
As we peer out from the lobby through its glass doors, day becomes night. SOMEONE leaves the building. Seated at a nearby cafe, SOMEONE springs to her feet at his approach. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS34
00:09:35,00 --> 00:09:41,50
As he checks his phone, she suddenly puts hers away. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS35
00:09:52,00 --> 00:09:57,50
He turns away, staring at his cell. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS36
00:10:18,00 --> 00:10:23,50
She pouts and lifts her brow. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS37
00:10:25,00 --> 00:10:31,50
She starts across the street, but SOMEONE remains on the sidewalk. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS39
00:10:51,00 --> 00:10:57,50
Later they sip drinks at an intimate table. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS40
00:11:37,00 --> 00:11:41,50
They share a smile. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS41
00:11:39,00 --> 00:11:44,50
SOMEONE walks by. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS42
00:11:52,00 --> 00:11:57,50
He bumps into the table. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS43
00:12:25,00 --> 00:12:30,50
He hugs SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS44
00:12:32,00 --> 00:12:37,50
Later on a sidewalk. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS45
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:05,50
They reach a gyros stand. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS46
00:13:04,00 --> 00:13:09,50
Now at a partially open security gate. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS47
00:13:10,00 --> 00:13:14,50
SOMEONE rolls underneath. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS48
00:13:12,00 --> 00:13:19,50
SOMEONE follows suit. Now SOMEONE leads him up a stairwell. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS49
00:13:17,00 --> 00:13:34,50
She carefully swings her legs over a security gate at the top and strides onward. SOMEONE opens the gate and steps through. Now SOMEONE leads him through a door. Both clutching their gyros they step out on a high rooftop overlooking Manhattan. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS50
00:13:42,00 --> 00:13:48,50
They walk to a corner with a view of the Empire State Building. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS51
00:13:48,00 --> 00:13:52,50
Later they eat. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS52
00:14:12,00 --> 00:14:17,50
SOMEONE's chewing slows and he averts his 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS53
00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:37,50
SOMEONE steps away. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS54
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:39,50
She sits down. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS55
00:14:36,00 --> 00:14:41,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie back side-by-side. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS57
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:40,50
They move through a crowd. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS58
00:15:41,00 --> 00:15:46,50
SOMEONE halts. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS59
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:53,50
Nearby a man holds up a boom box while another starts break dancing. The crowd parts for them. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS60
00:15:54,00 --> 00:16:10,50
Two other dancers join the first. All three strike stylized poses and nod their heads in unison. As they move into a Broadway style dance number, young people approach from all over the crowd. The performers slump down. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS61
00:16:11,00 --> 00:16:22,50
As they spring up and break into another set of moves, the dozens of young people join them. SOMEONE looks around bewilderedly. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS62
00:16:28,00 --> 00:16:34,50
He spots a huge monitor broadcasting the flash mob. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS63
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:39,50
She raises her arms and waves them in unison with the dancers. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS64
00:16:55,00 --> 00:17:02,50
The dancers lean over and back up, edging close to SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS65
00:17:03,00 --> 00:17:13,50
They bend over, too. The dancers straighten and point skyward. A forward leaning pose radiates from the back of the flash mob. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS66
00:17:13,00 --> 00:17:24,50
The boom box holder stands erect among the participants, as onlookers watch delightedly. The dancers straighten and raise their arms skyward, some with jazz hands. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS67
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:36,50
They clap along as they converse. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS68
00:17:34,00 --> 00:17:39,50
The dance concludes with a flourish. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS69
00:17:45,00 --> 00:17:50,50
On a plane, he talks with someone. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS70
00:17:59,00 --> 00:18:07,50
Now at night, a New York City cab drops SOMEONE off in an urban neighborhood. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS71
00:18:07,00 --> 00:18:13,50
He gazes about, full of wonder. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS72
00:18:15,00 --> 00:18:20,50
He grabs his bags. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS73
00:18:20,00 --> 00:18:48,50
Later he enters a sleek apartment, decorated in grays and browns. SOMEONE drops his bags. He steps past a black granite galley kitchen and descends into a sunken living room. A gift basket of bed sheets includes a note, SOMEONE, welcome to NYC. In case you shit the bed. Excuse the expression. Best, SOMEONE. SOMEONE runs to his bed and vaults hard on the mattress, jamming his shoulder. Now at GQ. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS74
00:19:01,00 --> 00:19:06,50
SOMEONE removes the door from its frame. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS75
00:19:09,00 --> 00:19:14,50
A fit balding guy greets him. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS76
00:19:34,00 --> 00:19:39,50
He strokes SOMEONE's cheeks. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS77
00:19:50,00 --> 00:19:55,50
He starts off, then backtracks. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS78
00:19:55,00 --> 00:20:02,50
SOMEONE peers off, stunned. Later, as he works, SOMEONE enters his office. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS79
00:20:03,00 --> 00:20:10,50
He shows her a web video of a woman dunking her breasts in cake batter. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS80
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:17,50
Another shows the Time Square flash mob. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS81
00:20:19,00 --> 00:20:25,50
The rows of dancers form the GQ logo. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS82
00:20:34,00 --> 00:20:40,50
SOMEONE takes a look at the inch-thick stack of documents. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS84
00:21:38,00 --> 00:21:43,50
Later in a corner diner. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS85
00:21:47,00 --> 00:21:52,50
He gets a call from SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS86
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:27,50
They share an amused smile. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS87
00:22:54,00 --> 00:22:59,50
Later SOMEONE opens her door to SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS88
00:23:11,00 --> 00:23:20,50
Later they play virtual table tennis. Now SOMEONE and others stick playing cards to their foreheads. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS89
00:23:19,00 --> 00:23:24,50
His reads Curious SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS90
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:52,50
Playing Jenga, SOMEONE intentionally topples the block tower. SOMEONE swigs beer, then passes out. SOMEONE graffities his face with marker. At GQ he notices traces of the graffiti. Now as SOMEONE holds up a lipstick sign at the airport, she sees SOMEONE's GQ flash mob ad on a kiosk. She photographs herself with it. At home SOMEONE grins at her email. At a party they view a canvas that features industrial looking stenciling. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS91
00:23:57,00 --> 00:24:06,50
SOMEONE passes out. As SOMEONE draws on her face, the marker leaves no apparent lines. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS92
00:24:04,00 --> 00:24:09,50
SOMEONE now addresses three executives. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS93
00:24:07,00 --> 00:24:24,50
As she dims the lights for a slideshow, glow-in-the-dark graffiti shows on her face, including eyebrows, the word Loser and cat whiskers. SOMEONE rubs her nose. Glowing ink transfers to her hand and she gawks.  

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS94
00:24:22,00 --> 00:24:28,50
Now in a movie, SOMEONE and SOMEONE co-star. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS95
00:24:29,00 --> 00:24:33,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch together. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS96
00:24:58,00 --> 00:25:03,50
In the movie, the leading man runs with flowers. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS97
00:25:32,00 --> 00:25:38,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE lip sync every word. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS98
00:25:37,00 --> 00:25:43,50
SOMEONE drops the flowers and kisses SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS99
00:25:58,00 --> 00:26:04,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a hansom cab. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS100
00:27:10,00 --> 00:27:14,50
They both swig a beer. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS101
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:22,50
In shorts and a tank top SOMEONE bends over to clear some clutter. Her cute butt mesmerizes SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS102
00:27:19,00 --> 00:27:24,50
He watches her rear as he is sitting on the couch. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS103
00:28:42,00 --> 00:28:46,50
SOMEONE steps away then return. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS104
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:10,50
He puts his hand on the virtual Bible. SOMEONE adds hers, and SOMEONE tops it. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS105
00:29:17,00 --> 00:29:21,50
They peer closely at each other. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS107
00:29:49,00 --> 00:29:53,50
He cups her bosom. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS108
00:29:55,00 --> 00:29:59,50
She walks away. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS109
00:30:12,00 --> 00:30:16,50
They get undressed. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS110
00:30:19,00 --> 00:30:26,50
With her back to us, she faces SOMEONE and ditches her bra. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS111
00:30:25,00 --> 00:30:32,50
SOMEONE drops his briefs. We view his bare butt, SOMEONE his front. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS112
00:30:29,00 --> 00:30:35,50
Now they fall back onto the bed, making out. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS114
00:31:16,00 --> 00:31:22,50
He pulls a shaggy teddy bear out from under the sheets. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS115
00:31:31,00 --> 00:31:38,50
She grabs his head by the hair, pulls his head to hers and pinches his tongue. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS116
00:31:57,00 --> 00:32:03,50
Now SOMEONE shuts her eyes ecstatically. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS117
00:32:14,00 --> 00:32:21,50
SOMEONE surfaces from the bed sheets then gives her a smug smile. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS118
00:32:19,00 --> 00:32:25,50
He flops down beside SOMEONE. Now she dives under the sheets. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS119
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:36,50
He makes an Oh-face. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS120
00:32:37,00 --> 00:32:42,50
SOMEONE emerges from the 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS121
00:32:47,00 --> 00:32:51,50
She kisses him. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS122
00:32:49,00 --> 00:32:54,50
They flop down beside each other. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS123
00:32:58,00 --> 00:33:07,50
Now at the GQ offices, SOMEONE compares to cover mockups, one featuring SOMEONE, the other President Obama. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS124
00:33:37,00 --> 00:33:42,50
SOMEONE goes to a waiting area where SOMEONE sits. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS125
00:33:43,00 --> 00:33:47,50
They greet each other with a 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS126
00:33:57,00 --> 00:34:02,50
Now the two stroll past artists. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS127
00:33:59,00 --> 00:34:05,50
Central Park, each avoiding the others' gaze. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS128
00:34:19,00 --> 00:34:23,50
SOMEONE gestures for her 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS129
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:19,50
An artist holds up a sketchpad. Now SOMEONE clutches a caricature of him and SOMEONE, as they burst into her apartment, kissing passionately. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS130
00:35:19,00 --> 00:35:24,50
They collapse on a chair. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS131
00:35:28,00 --> 00:35:34,50
Undressing her he spots a dog tattoo. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS132
00:35:47,00 --> 00:35:51,50
He shows his own tattoo. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS133
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:07,50
A series of images show SOMEONE and SOMEONE having sex on numerous occasions. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS134
00:36:14,00 --> 00:36:19,50
Now they watch a Mets game in their underwear. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS135
00:36:18,00 --> 00:36:27,50
They high-five, slap hands, and bump chests. SOMEONE leaps into SOMEONE's arms. Later they have sex in his bed. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS136
00:36:36,00 --> 00:36:41,50
Now they make out on a couch. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS137
00:36:42,00 --> 00:36:49,50
At another point he wears his socks in the shower with her. Now she lies on top of him. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS138
00:36:49,00 --> 00:36:53,50
They chew gum as they have sex. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS139
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:16,50
Their legs flail awkwardly under the covers as he rolls on top of her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS140
00:37:22,00 --> 00:37:29,50
In her bed, SOMEONE lies with her back to SOMEONE as their hips ungulate. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS141
00:37:31,00 --> 00:37:43,50
SOMEONE totters naked to the bathroom with one hand cupped over his crotch. He leaves the door open as he steps out of view. In bed, SOMEONE puffs out a breath, then frowns. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS142
00:37:50,00 --> 00:37:58,50
She shrugs and taps her abdomen. Looking into the bathroom, she finds SOMEONE sitting on the toilet. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS143
00:38:02,00 --> 00:38:07,50
She starts to lie down. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS144
00:38:05,00 --> 00:38:09,50
She sits up again. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS145
00:38:07,00 --> 00:38:13,50
The doorway shows one of SOMEONE's legs jerking upward. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS146
00:38:11,00 --> 00:38:17,50
He leans over awkwardly, bracing a hand on the bathtub. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS147
00:38:19,00 --> 00:38:24,50
He finishes and returns to the bedroom. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS148
00:38:35,00 --> 00:38:42,50
He dashes bare ass back into the bathroom. Now he stretches his legs. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS149
00:38:52,00 --> 00:38:57,50
A naked SOMEONE joins him in bed. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS150
00:39:15,00 --> 00:39:22,50
She grins and they start to have sex. An older woman saunters in. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS151
00:39:32,00 --> 00:39:36,50
She hugs SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS152
00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:56,50
She eyes SOMEONE's crotch. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS153
00:41:00,00 --> 00:41:05,50
SOMEONE leaves the room. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS154
00:41:20,00 --> 00:41:24,50
He carries her shoes past the 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS155
00:41:27,00 --> 00:41:32,50
Now SOMEONE plays basketball. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS156
00:41:29,00 --> 00:41:36,50
He passes the ball high and SOMEONE jams it into the hoop for a slam-dunk. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS157
00:41:49,00 --> 00:41:56,50
Later he dribbles and passes to SOMEONE who shoots and scores. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS158
00:41:57,00 --> 00:42:02,50
Later they sit at a SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS159
00:43:33,00 --> 00:43:42,50
SOMEONE leaps over a railing, separating the peer from the water. SOMEONE dashes over and finds him in a motor boat. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS160
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:53,50
SOMEONE drily lowers his 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS161
00:43:50,00 --> 00:44:05,50
Grinning SOMEONE puts on sunglasses then speeds of across the water. Now in her living room, SOMEONE sits on the floor in front of her mother, who arranges her hair into a chaotic mass of thick braids as they drink wine. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS162
00:44:38,00 --> 00:44:42,50
She joins SOMEONE on the sofa. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS163
00:45:34,00 --> 00:45:38,50
Her mother hugs her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS164
00:45:36,00 --> 00:45:41,50
SOMEONE eyes her hair in a mirror. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS165
00:45:45,00 --> 00:45:53,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE remove their jewelry as they lie in his bed in their underwear. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS166
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:04,50
Her gaze grows pensive as her 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS167
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:05,50
some friend leans over her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS168
00:46:35,00 --> 00:46:40,50
They pick through clothes, strewn about the room. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS169
00:46:52,00 --> 00:46:58,50
Now in Central Park they carry sandwiches 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS170
00:46:55,00 --> 00:46:59,50
Bethesda fountain. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS171
00:47:21,00 --> 00:47:28,50
He hands SOMEONE his sandwich. She looks on as he approaches the beauty. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS172
00:47:34,00 --> 00:47:40,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes and looks away. SOMEONE shakes the beauty's hand. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS173
00:47:38,00 --> 00:47:44,50
SOMEONE smiles and spreads her arms as he rejoins her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS174
00:47:59,00 --> 00:48:05,50
He knocks the sandwich out of her hand. Later. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS175
00:48:24,00 --> 00:48:29,50
She heads over. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS176
00:48:28,00 --> 00:48:34,50
She pauses to shoot SOMEONE a glare before reaching the stranger. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS177
00:48:39,00 --> 00:48:44,50
He waves cordially at her friend. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS178
00:48:42,00 --> 00:48:47,50
SOMEONE looks around then waves back. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS179
00:48:46,00 --> 00:48:51,50
She rejoins her friend. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS180
00:49:00,00 --> 00:49:04,50
They high-five. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS182
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:48,50
On her date. He mimes surgery. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS183
00:49:45,00 --> 00:49:52,50
He pretends to peek under the patient's sheet. A waitress brings the check. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS184
00:49:52,00 --> 00:49:58,50
SOMEONE covers his eyes with her hands, then removes them. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS186
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:25,50
SOMEONE lays a sympathetic hand on SOMEONE's. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS187
00:50:44,00 --> 00:50:49,50
Now a lunch date. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS188
00:51:24,00 --> 00:51:33,50
She gets a text from SOMEONE. It reads, How's it going with Stares at Trees? @ GQ. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS189
00:51:43,00 --> 00:51:49,50
SOMEONE gets a photo message showing SOMEONE with SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS190
00:51:55,00 --> 00:52:02,50
Now SOMEONE makes out with SOMEONE on her couch. She falls back and smiles at him, meaningfully. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS191
00:52:06,00 --> 00:52:14,50
He moves in for another kiss. SOMEONE lies back and he leans over her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS192
00:52:13,00 --> 00:52:18,50
She switches off a lamp. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS194
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:24,50
A woman snarls amorously in his ear. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS195
00:52:25,00 --> 00:52:31,50
In short shorts she straddles his leg. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS196
00:52:37,00 --> 00:52:48,50
As SOMEONE picks up his cell phone, his date lifts his arm, smells his armpit and licks his tricep. SOMEONE puts the phone to his ear. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS197
00:52:52,00 --> 00:52:59,50
She grins, licks her fingertip, and strokes his ear. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS198
00:52:59,00 --> 00:53:08,50
The woman plants kisses down his lifted arms toward his armpit. Moving his sleeve aside she sniffs deeply. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS199
00:53:05,00 --> 00:53:15,50
She exhales in SOMEONE's face. He raises a finger, gesturing for her to pause. She demurely backs off. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS200
00:53:19,00 --> 00:53:26,50
The woman runs her fingers through his hair as he ends the call. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS201
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:35,50
She takes SOMEONE's hands and pounds them against her chest. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS202
00:53:37,00 --> 00:53:54,50
Now sunlight shines on SOMEONE's hair as she sleeps, spooning with SOMEONE on her sofa. She wakes and gets up groggily. Clad in a T-shirt and panties, she digs behind a sofa cushion, pulls out her cellphone. The display shows SOMEONE's photo and she 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS203
00:54:03,00 --> 00:54:09,50
She finds SOMEONE conked out on her bed. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS204
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:39,50
SOMEONE pulls on cut-off jeans shorts. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS205
00:54:36,00 --> 00:54:40,50
With a bra in one hand, she open a door and glances at him. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS207
00:54:40,00 --> 00:54:45,50
As she shuts the door he stirs and stretches. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS208
00:54:43,00 --> 00:54:48,50
Now SOMEONE arrives on the sidewalk. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS209
00:55:00,00 --> 00:55:05,50
SOMEONE buys coffees. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS210
00:55:18,00 --> 00:55:24,50
SOMEONE spies SOMEONE on the move, buttoning his shirt. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS211
00:55:26,00 --> 00:55:31,50
She jogs over with the coffees. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS212
00:56:04,00 --> 00:56:12,50
She drops his coffee in a trash bin, then marches off drinking her own. SOMEONE stares after her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS213
00:56:11,00 --> 00:56:18,50
He goes. Later she visits SOMEONE as he packs for his trip. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS214
00:57:04,00 --> 00:57:14,50
SOMEONE presents a large graphic art canvas, featuring a rider on a horse. In one corner stenciled letters follow the @ symbol with ftail. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS215
00:57:36,00 --> 00:57:42,50
SOMEONE glares, then paddles her feet on the bed. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS216
00:57:44,00 --> 00:57:50,50
He grabs her ankles. Later SOMEONE arrives home with the painting. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS217
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:54,50
She sets it down and crosses her home. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS218
00:57:55,00 --> 00:58:15,50
Heading back through the kitchen she spots a hand scrawled note posted on the fridge. It reads, SOMEONE, sorry, back to Cleveland with Lombard Victor, xoxo, love mom. SOMEONE digs her cellphone from her bag and photographs the note. On his way to a cab, SOMEONE receives the photo. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS219
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:15,50
Now beyond Griffith Observatory's Hilltop, downtown L.A. spans the horizon. An aerial view glides over rows of houses, boats in a marina, and a freeway interchange. SOMEONE occupies a window seat on a plane, SOMEONE's on the aisle. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS220
00:59:31,00 --> 00:59:37,50
Two young girls in front of them look at SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS221
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:50,50
They turn away. Now we float over Hollywood, then track a car on a meandering frontage road boarded by luxury homes. We arrive at an upscale Oceanside neighborhood. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS222
00:59:51,00 --> 00:59:56,50
SOMEONE gets their bags. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS223
00:59:53,00 --> 01:00:01,50
They enter a friendly stylish home where open double doors reveal a beachfront patio. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS224
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:16,50
They go out to the patio.

He hugs a boy in a tuxedo. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS226
01:00:31,00 --> 01:00:37,50
SOMEONE produces a flame from his fingertips. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS227
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:45,50
His sleeve bursts into flames. SOMEONE and SOMEONE remove his jacket. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS228
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:47,50
A tall blond woman arrives. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS229
01:00:48,00 --> 01:00:52,50
SOMEONE high-fives them and goes. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS230
01:00:56,00 --> 01:01:01,50
She lifts him in a hug. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS232
01:01:48,00 --> 01:01:53,50
by the ocean, SOMEONE kisses her father's cheek. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS233
01:01:59,00 --> 01:02:07,50
As his father goes inside in his shirt and skivvies, SOMEONE shoots a look at SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS234
01:02:20,00 --> 01:02:37,50
SOMEONE escorts SOMEONE down to the beach and SOMEONE goes inside. Later the two friends throw stones at the curling waves, then trot off over the sand. At night, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit on the patio, looking through a photo album. A fire burns in a nearby sandpit. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS236
01:03:51,00 --> 01:03:56,50
SOMEONE goes inside. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS237
01:03:55,00 --> 01:04:01,50
Later, SOMEONE checks on SOMEONE who reads in bed. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS238
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:12,50
He unties his bathrobe. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS239
01:04:11,00 --> 01:04:16,50
He peels it back. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS241
01:05:49,00 --> 01:06:09,50
Everyday math for dummies. Now the friends drink wine and dance around the room. Later SOMEONE kneels on the bed and swigs from the bottle. Later still, as he snoozes, she dips his hand in a glass of wine, then hides. He wakes and rushes out, holding his crotch. As he returns she pops up. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS242
01:06:07,00 --> 01:06:12,50
Now they lounge in bed, barefoot. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS244
01:07:05,00 --> 01:07:10,50
She catches SOMEONE smiling fondly at her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS245
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:12,50
He shyly zips his 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS246
01:07:20,00 --> 01:07:37,50
SOMEONE gives a wry, knowing smirk, and sets his wine aside. Facing SOMEONE again, he finds her staring longingly at him. Holding his gaze, she leans in, lays a hand on his chest and plants a tender kiss on his lips. SOMEONE kisses her back then gives a 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS247
01:07:40,00 --> 01:07:44,50
Her lips coyly brush his. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS248
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:50,50
Cradling his head in her hand, she draws his mouth to hers again. SOMEONE's hand slides down his chest. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS249
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:56,50
SOMEONE slips her hand beneath his robe. She pushes it open, caressing his chest and looks up at him coyly. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS250
01:07:59,00 --> 01:08:03,50
They lock gazes. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS251
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:04,50
Playful smiles fade. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS252
01:08:04,00 --> 01:08:09,50
SOMEONE leans close, bringing her lips to him. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS253
01:08:08,00 --> 01:08:16,50
SOMEONE's hand brushes under her hair and his gentle kisses grow more impassioned. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS254
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:24,50
Later he lies on top of her as their mouths meet in a series of light caresses. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS255
01:08:24,00 --> 01:08:31,50
With SOMEONE between her legs SOMEONE brings one leg toward her chest. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS256
01:08:29,00 --> 01:08:37,50
Now he rests a hand on her heaving chest as he plants kisses along her thigh. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS257
01:08:35,00 --> 01:08:49,50
Later they lie beneath the sheets as they kiss with mounting intensity. As SOMEONE lies on his back, SOMEONE plants a row of kisses down his abdomen. His hand caresses her back. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS258
01:08:47,00 --> 01:08:59,50
Now the two gaze into each other’s eyes emotionally as their lips brush. Later SOMEONE lies on top of SOMEONE, regarding him with a tender smile. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS259
01:08:56,00 --> 01:09:04,50
He draws her into a kiss and their interlocked hands drift off the mattress. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS260
01:09:01,00 --> 01:09:07,50
Later, SOMEONE's leg pokes out from under a sheet. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS261
01:09:05,00 --> 01:09:12,50
SOMEONE's arm lies draped across his stomach, her hand to his, as she sleeps with her 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS262
01:09:11,00 --> 01:09:15,50
SOMEONE slumbers. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS263
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:19,50
In the hall, SOMEONE groggily walks into the Saw a Woman in half box. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS264
01:09:17,00 --> 01:09:21,50
SOMEONE wakes. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS265
01:09:19,00 --> 01:09:26,50
As his sister limps down the hall, SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE, who slumbers on. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS266
01:09:23,00 --> 01:09:28,50
He gingerly removes her hand and sits up. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS267
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:31,50
He slips out of bed without waking her and pulls his hand. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS268
01:09:34,00 --> 01:09:40,50
SOMEONE glimpses SOMEONE sneaking out of SOMEONE's room in his robe. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS270
01:09:42,00 --> 01:09:45,50
In the morning, SOMEONE, SOMEONE and their dad have breakfast on the patio right in front of ocean. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS271
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:16,50
Mr. SOMEONE lets SOMEONE take his 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS272
01:10:22,00 --> 01:10:27,50
SOMEONE's sleeve dispenses coffee. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS273
01:10:37,00 --> 01:10:46,50
SOMEONE bows, then leaves. Smiling SOMEONE wipes the corner of SOMEONE's mouth. SOMEONE and Mr. SOMEONE just 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS274
01:10:52,00 --> 01:10:58,50
He aloofly sips his coffee. SOMEONE's smile fades. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS275
01:10:56,00 --> 01:11:01,50
Now on jet skis. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS276
01:11:00,00 --> 01:11:07,50
The two riders cruise by floating kelp. Two dolphins swim near. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS277
01:11:47,00 --> 01:11:52,50
At night, they all dine by a marina. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS278
01:13:14,00 --> 01:13:21,50
He angrily pushes away from the table and stands, then trips and falls. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS279
01:13:22,00 --> 01:13:28,50
A stranger tries to help. SOMEONE intervenes. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS280
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:34,50
SOMEONE keeps his hands off and looks helplessly to SOMEONE. Their dad walks away. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS281
01:13:36,00 --> 01:13:44,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a parting caress then hurries after her dad. SOMEONE uneasily notices diners staring. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS282
01:13:42,00 --> 01:13:46,50
SOMEONE rubs SOMEONE's back. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS284
01:13:49,00 --> 01:13:58,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hike a city overlook.  

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS285
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:36,50
The Hollywood sign stands tall downhill of them behind a fence. SOMEONE climbs the fence. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS286
01:14:49,00 --> 01:14:54,50
He gives the cameras a thumbs up. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS287
01:14:55,00 --> 01:15:04,50
An airborne view orbits the huge white letters. SOMEONE and SOMEONE dangle their legs from the second O. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS288
01:16:25,00 --> 01:16:30,50
A helicopter rises in front of them. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS289
01:16:37,00 --> 01:16:42,50
SOMEONE stares at the chopper. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS290
01:16:58,00 --> 01:17:03,50
Later a newscast shows SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS291
01:17:12,00 --> 01:17:17,50
They fight for the remote. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS292
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:05,50
Now SOMEONE lies in a long box. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS293
01:18:04,00 --> 01:18:12,50
As SOMEONE leaves, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE enter. SOMEONE ducks completely inside the box. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS294
01:18:56,00 --> 01:19:00,50
SOMEONE stares. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS295
01:19:03,00 --> 01:19:10,50
SOMEONE steps out toward the beach. SOMEONE slouches then follows. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS296
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:20,50
Left alone, SOMEONE lifts away a top panel of the box and climbs out. She replaces the cover, glances outside and jogs out of the room in the opposite direction. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS297
01:19:18,00 --> 01:19:26,50
Nighttime. SOMEONE and his family occupy four of the five chairs around the table. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS298
01:19:31,00 --> 01:19:36,50
SOMEONE enters the room. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS299
01:19:52,00 --> 01:19:57,50
SOMEONE steps over to SOMEONE. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS300
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:26,50
She leaves the house. SOMEONE gawks at his family and shrugs. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS301
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:34,50
He shakes his head and hustles after her. SOMEONE glances tentatively at their dad. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS302
01:20:36,00 --> 01:20:41,50
SOMEONE returns to the dining nook. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS303
01:20:43,00 --> 01:20:48,50
He retakes his seat at the untouched 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS304
01:20:45,00 --> 01:20:52,50
spread of wine, salad, pasta, and bread. SOMEONE takes a resigned breath. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS305
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:53,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS306
01:20:55,00 --> 01:21:00,50
His smile fades and his eyes grows wide. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS307
01:21:00,00 --> 01:21:14,50
In New York City, morning sunlight washes across the horizon of buildings. In an airport concourse, SOMEONE walks sadly within the flow of travelers. Later she enters her apartment. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS308
01:21:13,00 --> 01:21:28,50
She checks her cellphone. A text from SOMEONE reads, Get home okay? She exits the screen and puts down the phone. Now at GQ SOMEONE works at his desk. SOMEONE arrives in his open doorway. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS309
01:22:13,00 --> 01:22:20,50
In another office, SOMEONE reads up on Chelsie Shallenburger on her laptop. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS310
01:22:17,00 --> 01:22:25,50
An IM comes in from her mom. So sorry I bailed last weekend, can I please come back? 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS311
01:22:23,00 --> 01:22:29,50
SOMEONE sends a cell call from SOMEONE to her voicemail. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS312
01:22:30,00 --> 01:22:35,50
Now SOMEONE and her mom play the table 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS313
01:22:45,00 --> 01:22:51,50
Her mother sees SOMEONE's face on SOMEONE's cell display. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS314
01:22:58,00 --> 01:23:02,50
SOMEONE ignores the call. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS315
01:23:10,00 --> 01:23:17,50
SOMEONE gives her daughter an unassuming glance and plods away with her drink. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS316
01:23:15,00 --> 01:23:20,50
SOMEONE picks up a game controller. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS317
01:23:17,00 --> 01:23:21,50
She talks into it like a microphone. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS318
01:24:01,00 --> 01:24:07,50
Now on a busy sidewalk, SOMEONE tries calling. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS319
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:18,50
The glass face of his smart phone reflects 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS320
01:24:15,00 --> 01:24:27,50
A steeple and high-rise behind him. He turns to look at the actual structures. Now SOMEONE peers out from the rooftop overlooking Manhattan. SOMEONE joins her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS321
01:26:05,00 --> 01:26:10,50
As SOMEONE strides away, SOMEONE 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS322
01:26:07,00 --> 01:26:12,50
nonplussed in the stark sunlight. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS323
01:26:10,00 --> 01:26:14,50
A nearby security guard sees 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS324
01:26:30,00 --> 01:26:35,50
At night, SOMEONE cries as she crosses a street. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS325
01:26:43,00 --> 01:26:50,50
Now the SOMEONE and SOMEONE movie plays on SOMEONE's TV. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS326
01:26:55,00 --> 01:27:01,50
SOMEONE swigs a beer watching their screen kiss. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS329
01:27:11,00 --> 01:27:16,50
Now SOMEONE gets a call from the office. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS330
01:27:25,00 --> 01:27:30,50
She hangs up and speed dials a number 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS331
01:27:32,00 --> 01:27:42,50
She hangs up and strides out of the lady's room. Later at GQ, SOMEONE marches over to SOMEONE's office. He's not there. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS332
01:28:00,00 --> 01:28:05,50
She indicates her nose. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS333
01:28:04,00 --> 01:28:08,50
At the photo shoot. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS334
01:28:15,00 --> 01:28:23,50
Male models pose with sports items held in front of their flesh colored jockstraps. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS335
01:28:30,00 --> 01:28:36,50
Topless females join them. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS336
01:28:48,00 --> 01:28:53,50
He takes SOMEONE aside. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS337
01:29:30,00 --> 01:29:38,50
As she leaves, SOMEONE frowns to himself. SOMEONE directs a Caucasian male model. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS338
01:29:36,00 --> 01:29:44,50
An Asian male model spreads his arms as the other man holds him horizontally. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS339
01:29:42,00 --> 01:30:01,50
That night, SOMEONE walks into his kitchen, throws down his bag and turns on the lights. He gets a beer from his windowed refrigerator. As he goes to open it, he notices the note he received with the gift basket of sheets. SOMEONE, welcome to NYC. In case you shit the bed. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS342
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:36,50
SOMEONE faces his reflection in a window. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS343
01:30:42,00 --> 01:30:48,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in Central Park together. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS344
01:32:03,00 --> 01:32:08,50
Sitting side-by-side on a boulder, they hug. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS345
01:32:11,00 --> 01:32:16,50
Now SOMEONE waits at the airport. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS346
01:32:15,00 --> 01:32:25,50
Through a wall of windows he watches his dad get pushed up a boarding ramp in a wheel chair. SOMEONE follows and meets them at the gate. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS348
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:56,50
He approaches a hostess at the airport restaurant. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS349
01:33:08,00 --> 01:33:14,50
SOMEONE turns away and finds his father gone. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS350
01:33:12,00 --> 01:33:21,50
Returning to the hostess stand he peers inside the crowded restaurant, then proceeds inside. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS351
01:33:24,00 --> 01:33:39,50
He finds his father hanging his trousers over a railing, then sitting down at an empty table in his shirt, jacket, and boxers. SOMEONE frowns. As Mr. SOMEONE casually opens a menu, his son trudges over. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS352
01:33:38,00 --> 01:33:50,50
SOMEONE takes a heavy breath. Patrons at the nearby tables begin to stare. A man and woman trade a sober look. Standing frozen to the spot, SOMEONE narrows his eyes. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS353
01:33:48,00 --> 01:33:55,50
He removes his shoes, pulls out a chair at the table, and takes off his own pants. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS354
01:34:00,00 --> 01:34:11,50
Later the father and son eat lunch together in their boxers. Mr. SOMEONE notices a young woman using her cellphone outside the restaurant. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS355
01:34:11,00 --> 01:34:15,50
She walks away obliviously. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS356
01:34:13,00 --> 01:34:22,50
As the other patrons look over at Mr. SOMEONE again, he lowers his befuddled gaze. SOMEONE studies him. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS357
01:34:22,00 --> 01:34:28,50
Mr. SOMEONE snaps out of his reverie and takes a few deeps breaths. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS358
01:35:26,00 --> 01:35:31,50
He gestures to his head. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS359
01:35:31,00 --> 01:35:36,50
He sees SOMEONE's somber face. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS360
01:35:35,00 --> 01:35:42,50
His son hangs his head. Mr. SOMEONE stares at him with a knitted brow. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS361
01:36:16,00 --> 01:36:21,50
Now SOMEONE uses his phone. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS362
01:36:23,00 --> 01:36:29,50
His dad bumps into SOMEONE and drops his bag. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS363
01:36:34,00 --> 01:36:38,50
SOMEONE bumps into him. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS364
01:36:42,00 --> 01:36:47,50
He indicates SOMEONE,then himself. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS366
01:36:52,00 --> 01:36:57,50
He tucks a loose lock of hair behind Shaun's ear. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS367
01:37:05,00 --> 01:37:12,50
Now traffic comes to a standstill where seven lanes merge into two. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS368
01:37:14,00 --> 01:37:19,50
SOMEONE sends a text message. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS369
01:37:20,00 --> 01:37:27,50
Now he and his dad speed across the Hudson river with SOMEONE in his boat. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS370
01:37:42,00 --> 01:37:47,50
SOMEONE makes a phone call on his cell. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS371
01:37:50,00 --> 01:37:57,50
That night in his apartment he gives his father his business card. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS372
01:38:05,00 --> 01:38:10,50
He eyes a copy of GQ. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS373
01:38:18,00 --> 01:38:23,50
He passes a guy in the kitchen. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS374
01:38:29,00 --> 01:38:34,50
Akron, central  terminal. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS375
01:38:44,00 --> 01:38:51,50
The bustling crowd around SOMEONE suddenly stops and dances. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS376
01:38:50,00 --> 01:38:55,50
In her apartment her mother smiles. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS377
01:39:00,00 --> 01:39:07,50
SOMEONE looks at the stairs and sees SOMEONE standing there. He shrugs at her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS378
01:39:10,00 --> 01:39:17,50
The people in the flash mob stop their frenetic jumping and square off. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS379
01:39:16,00 --> 01:39:21,50
SOMEONE mouths the lyrics. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS380
01:39:24,00 --> 01:39:31,50
He beams. The flash mob performs a choreographed routine. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS381
01:39:43,00 --> 01:39:53,50
Watching the dancers twirl their partners all around her, SOMEONE allows an emotional smile. SOMEONE stands watching her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS382
01:40:01,00 --> 01:40:07,50
He comes down from the stairs and walks closer to her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS383
01:40:39,00 --> 01:40:47,50
He takes her hand and leads her to a balcony, overlooking the ballroom dancing flash mob. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS384
01:40:57,00 --> 01:41:02,50
He kneels before her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS385
01:41:12,00 --> 01:41:16,50
He stands facing her. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS386
01:41:31,00 --> 01:41:36,50
The flash mob freezes mid dance. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS387
01:41:36,00 --> 01:41:49,50
He cuts her off with a deep, passionate kiss and lifts her off her feet while the performers remain perfectly still below them. With their lips still pressed together, SOMEONE opens her eyes and smiles. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS388
01:41:57,00 --> 01:42:05,50
The members of the flash mob abruptly disburse as if they're just commuters going about their business. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS389
01:42:05,00 --> 01:42:11,50
SOMEONE wipes tears from her big almond shaped eyes. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS390
01:42:12,00 --> 01:42:18,50
Outside, a horse drawn carriage waits at the curb. 

FRIENDS_WITH_BENEFITS_DVS391
01:42:39,00 --> 01:42:46,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE cross the street to Pershing Square Central Cafe and have their date. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS23
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:51,50
SOMEONE jogs after the hurrying stilt-walker. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS25
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:25,50
Still in his Uncle SOMEONE jacket and beard, the young man races across a building's roof. He halts at its edge and eyes a police van below. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS26
00:03:22,00 --> 00:03:44,50
At ground level, SOMEONE sprints past the burning parade float. On the roof the young man scampers one way then races back the other way with SOMEONE on his tail. The rugged man chases his target to the roof's edge where the young man leaps off. SOMEONE follows. They land on the police van, then hit the ground hard. Police surround them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS27
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:55,50
SOMEONE hands an officer his badge and ID. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS28
00:03:59,00 --> 00:04:04,50
SOMEONE gingerly gets to his feet. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS29
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:08,50
SOMEONE grabs the young man and cuffs him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS30
00:04:22,00 --> 00:04:36,50
The officer cuffs SOMEONE. Now, SOMEONE steps off an elevator - phone in hand - and strides past a reception desk. Golden letters behind it read, Daily News.  She passes a colleague. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS31
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:46,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE's rear. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS32
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:55,50
SOMEONE enters a newsroom. As she heads to her desk, a mustached man watches her shapely bottom. SOMEONE finds a print-out of her mugshot taped to her computer. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS33
00:04:57,00 --> 00:05:04,50
A sticky-note reads, Don't forget court tomorrow. Mr. Ed. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS34
00:05:02,00 --> 00:05:06,50
The mustached man sits by her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS35
00:06:03,00 --> 00:06:11,50
Meanwhile, police officers mingle at a bar. The bartender answers the phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS36
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:32,50
SOMEONE jots on a coaster. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS37
00:06:42,00 --> 00:06:47,50
In a stall, SOMEONE hangs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS38
00:06:45,00 --> 00:06:49,50
She claps her feet together. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS39
00:06:47,00 --> 00:06:53,50
As she bursts out of the stall, SOMEONE exits a different one. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS40
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:20,50
She leaves. SOMEONE grins at the mirror. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS41
00:07:20,00 --> 00:07:28,50
He plucks a tissue from a box. Later, SOMEONE strolls across the roof of an apartment building. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS42
00:07:25,00 --> 00:07:33,50
Reaching a corner, she leans on a railing and peers over the edge. She shakes her head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS43
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:40,50
She takes her phone from her bag and answers it as she returns to the roof's corner. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS44
00:07:57,00 --> 00:08:01,50
At a spa, SOMEONE talks on phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS46
00:08:39,00 --> 00:08:46,50
Nighttime at a police station, a man in a sport coat approaches a jail cell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS47
00:08:45,00 --> 00:08:55,50
He shows a badge on his belt. An officer releases SOMEONE from the cell. Now, SOMEONE and his police friend eat at a diner. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS48
00:09:22,00 --> 00:09:29,50
As SOMEONE chomps into a taco doused with hot sauce, his friend swigs a coke. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS49
00:09:31,00 --> 00:09:36,50
SOMEONE drops his taco on his plate. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS50
00:09:50,00 --> 00:09:56,50
Now at a courthouse, a man uses his phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS51
00:09:58,00 --> 00:10:02,50
A cab pulls up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS52
00:10:24,00 --> 00:10:28,50
She answers her phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS53
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:52,50
He hangs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS55
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:19,50
the judge follows SOMEONE's gaze to the closed double-doors. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS56
00:11:31,00 --> 00:11:37,50
Meanwhile, in the parking lot of a Dunkin' Donuts and a Baskin Robbins plaza, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS57
00:11:35,00 --> 00:11:44,50
SOMEONE sits in his car, nervously tapping his steering wheel. He glances over his shoulder and blows out an impatient breath. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS58
00:11:42,00 --> 00:11:48,50
A man smashes his window with a crowbar. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS60
00:11:47,00 --> 00:11:52,50
He pulls SOMEONE out of his car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS61
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:55,50
He shoves him into an SUV. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS62
00:11:53,00 --> 00:12:04,50
As he slams the door, a cab pulls into the parking lot. SOMEONE climbs out and sees the chiseled stranger speeding away in his black SUV. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS63
00:12:02,00 --> 00:12:12,50
She frowns. Now, in another neighborhood a portly man exits the front door of a house with an adjoining storefront. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS64
00:12:18,00 --> 00:12:40,50
He opens a gate. As he follows the sidewalk, he roots around in the pocket of his cargo shorts and pulls out a set of keys. Stopping at the storefront's glass door, he unlocks it and heads inside. A sign on the window reads, Sid's Bail Bonds. The portly man flips on the lights and finds SOMEONE asleep, sprawled across a leather loveseat. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS65
00:12:42,00 --> 00:12:47,50
SOMEONE groggily opens his eyes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS66
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:52,50
SOMEONE sits up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS67
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:02,50
Later, SOMEONE packs his station wagon. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS68
00:13:42,00 --> 00:13:46,50
He reaches for his pocket. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS69
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:53,50
He hands SOMEONE a folded piece of paper. The bounty hunter opens it and finds SOMEONE's mugshot. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS70
00:13:50,00 --> 00:13:55,50
He meets SOMEONE's gaze. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS71
00:13:54,00 --> 00:13:58,50
SOMEONE grins. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS72
00:14:22,00 --> 00:14:27,50
SOMEONE does a dance. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS73
00:14:28,00 --> 00:14:32,50
He hugs SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS74
00:14:30,00 --> 00:14:35,50
He kisses him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS75
00:14:37,00 --> 00:14:45,50
SOMEONE takes the check from SOMEONE's red-headed assistant and gives her a long, deep kiss. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS76
00:14:47,00 --> 00:14:53,50
SOMEONE takes it from his mouth and puts it in hers. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS77
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:17,50
Now at his place, a freshly showered SOMEONE grins at his reflection in a bathroom mirror as he brushes his teeth. Later, he packs a Taser and two guns into a bag. He heads outside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS78
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:27,50
Now, he rings SOMEONE's bell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS79
00:15:31,00 --> 00:15:36,50
He jiggles the locked door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS80
00:15:40,00 --> 00:15:51,50
SOMEONE scales a wall and lands in a muddy flowerbed. Tracking footprints, he enters SOMEONE's apartment through a back door and eyes her tasteful decor. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS81
00:15:53,00 --> 00:16:20,50
As he strolls into the spacious living room, SOMEONE notices his muddy footprints on a light rug. With a grin, he steps to the side dragging his foot and tracking a long smear. In the bathroom, he drops SOMEONE's toothbrush in the toilet, then places it back in its holder. In the bedroom, he lounges on SOMEONE's bed - his muddy shoes on her duvet. He snacks on a pile of nacho cheese Doritos, spilled conveniently within reach. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS82
00:16:17,00 --> 00:16:36,50
SOMEONE deletes saved episodes of Weeds and 30 Rock from SOMEONE's TiVo. Meanwhile, SOMEONE keys into a clean white front door. As she enters, SOMEONE freezes on the bed and glances toward the hall. Chewing Doritos, he tosses down the remote and wipes his mouth and hands on a pillow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS83
00:16:34,00 --> 00:16:43,50
SOMEONE searches a small pink-tiled bathroom. SOMEONE draws his gun and creeps into the hall. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS84
00:16:41,00 --> 00:16:46,50
SOMEONE peers around a corner. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS85
00:16:43,00 --> 00:16:48,50
SOMEONE skulks down the stairs. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS86
00:16:47,00 --> 00:16:56,50
SOMEONE defensively grabs a picture frame and presses her back to a wall by a white-trim doorway. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS87
00:16:56,00 --> 00:17:05,50
As she turns the corner, SOMEONE reaches the white door frame at the bottom of the stairs. They both turn the corner. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS88
00:17:04,00 --> 00:17:08,50
SOMEONE scares a cat. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS89
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:13,50
SOMEONE aims his gun at SOMEONE. SOMEONE's at a completely different address. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS90
00:17:10,00 --> 00:17:15,50
Back at her place, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS91
00:17:18,00 --> 00:17:22,50
SOMEONE aims at SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS92
00:17:36,00 --> 00:17:40,50
SOMEONE cocks his head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS94
00:17:52,00 --> 00:17:57,50
the cat hides under a chair. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS95
00:18:27,00 --> 00:18:31,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS97
00:18:56,00 --> 00:19:01,50
he swigs juice from a carton. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS98
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:15,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS99
00:19:17,00 --> 00:19:21,50
SOMEONE's grin vanishes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS100
00:19:51,00 --> 00:19:56,50
SOMEONE grabs the phone and hits redial. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS101
00:20:02,00 --> 00:20:06,50
He hits the disconnect button. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS102
00:20:06,00 --> 00:20:22,50
Now, in SOMEONE's pink-tiled bathroom, SOMEONE searches a vanity then picks through dirty laundry strewn around the tub. She finds a bar coaster in a pair of jeans. A note on the back reads, Audit Evidence Depository. Missing shit. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS103
00:20:21,00 --> 00:20:27,50
Now, on her cell, she crosses the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS104
00:20:33,00 --> 00:20:38,50
SOMEONE exits an evidence locker while on his cell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS105
00:21:03,00 --> 00:21:14,50
Now, SOMEONE leaves SOMEONE's building. As he gets into his car, SOMEONE creeps outside and scurries over to a red MINI Cooper. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS106
00:21:11,00 --> 00:21:22,50
Now, a bird's-eye view shows SOMEONE's car exiting a tunnel and approaching a toll plaza. Later, the baby blue ragtop crosses the bridge. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS107
00:21:19,00 --> 00:21:31,50
Later still, it drives beneath an overpass sign reading, Welcome to Atlantic City. A billboard, featuring SOMEONE's mother, reads, Kitty Borgata. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS108
00:21:28,00 --> 00:21:39,50
Now, we glimpse lavish buildings housing Atlantic City's hotel casinos. In a lounge, Kitty stands in the spotlight on a stage. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS109
00:21:47,00 --> 00:21:52,50
SOMEONE enters and smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS110
00:21:53,00 --> 00:21:59,50
Shading her eyes, Kitty peers out at him, he waves. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS111
00:22:03,00 --> 00:22:07,50
She slaps him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS112
00:22:12,00 --> 00:22:18,50
Kitty gives him a big hug. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS113
00:22:37,00 --> 00:22:42,50
she slips off her pumps. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS114
00:23:03,00 --> 00:23:07,50
SOMEONE brightens. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS115
00:23:10,00 --> 00:23:34,50
At a racetrack, people crowd the stands. An older woman rubs sunblock on her bare arms. A young woman in a flowered hat eyes her tickets. Jockeys ride their horses toward the starting gate. The race begins and the animals burst onto the track. Two young women cheer. Sitting alone on a long bench, SOMEONE thoughtfully pieces through her collective notes, which include the coaster. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS116
00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:38,50
She digs her cell from her purse and answers. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS117
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:47,50
Standing near a corral, SOMEONE grins. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS118
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:57,50
SOMEONE finds SOMEONE sharing her bench. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS119
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:06,50
He affects a nonchalant shake of the head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS120
00:24:12,00 --> 00:24:18,50
SOMEONE's brow nits distrustfully. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS121
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:31,50
SOMEONE looks away, shifting her wary gaze then frowns at him again. He smirks. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS122
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:35,50
Standing, he steps before her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS123
00:24:34,00 --> 00:24:39,50
SOMEONE smiles and shakes her head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS124
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:46,50
She starts to go. His leg blocks her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS126
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:16,50
A race starts and SOMEONE runs too. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS127
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:18,50
She hurries up an aisle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS128
00:26:16,00 --> 00:26:20,50
The horses race down the track. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS129
00:26:22,00 --> 00:26:28,50
SOMEONE rubs his hands together, inhales through them, and dashes off. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS130
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:35,50
As SOMEONE trots through a picnic area, SOMEONE sprints through a lobby. Emerging outside, SOMEONE finds him blocking her path. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS131
00:26:37,00 --> 00:26:50,50
She runs off the other way. We glimpse the racing horses' legs, SOMEONE's high heels, and SOMEONE's sneakered feet. At a concession stand, he cuts SOMEONE off and offers popcorn. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS132
00:26:50,00 --> 00:26:57,50
She bats it away and flees. On a patio, SOMEONE intercepts her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS133
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:01,50
She passes him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS134
00:26:59,00 --> 00:27:06,50
SOMEONE's four-inch stiletto heels carry her out to a drop-off area. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS135
00:27:04,00 --> 00:27:12,50
She approaches two rows of waiting cabs parked along a curb. SOMEONE's convertible arrives, blocking them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS136
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:20,50
SOMEONE gets out, steps in her path, and draws a gun. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS137
00:27:21,00 --> 00:27:25,50
She brushes past him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS138
00:27:30,00 --> 00:27:36,50
As SOMEONE swaggers over, she tensely faces him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS139
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:39,50
He steps in close. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS140
00:27:39,00 --> 00:27:45,50
Finding herself head to head with her ex, SOMEONE backs up a pace. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS141
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:55,50
He hefts her over his shoulder. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS142
00:27:55,00 --> 00:28:01,50
She slaps at his back as he carries her to his car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS143
00:28:01,00 --> 00:28:06,50
He pops the trunk and dumps her in. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS144
00:28:11,00 --> 00:28:16,50
SOMEONE hurries toward him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS145
00:28:15,00 --> 00:28:19,50
In the trunk, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS146
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:27,50
she smacks the lid. Her ex-husband backs the car up then pulls away. SOMEONE watches helplessly. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS147
00:28:26,00 --> 00:28:33,50
He rushes off. Now, a storefront sign reads, Blue Ink Tattoos. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS148
00:28:32,00 --> 00:28:38,50
Inside, SOMEONE's captor readies a needle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS149
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:45,50
Duct tape holds SOMEONE's head in place. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS150
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:48,50
His captor waves the needle in his face. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS151
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:07,50
The chiseled thug blinks. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS152
00:29:06,00 --> 00:29:13,50
At Sid's Bail Bonds, Teresa chews gum as she strolls to the phone and answers it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS153
00:29:42,00 --> 00:29:47,50
SOMEONE checks his cell display. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS154
00:29:48,00 --> 00:29:52,50
SOMEONE takes the incoming call. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS155
00:31:43,00 --> 00:31:48,50
The thug holds him at gunpoint. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS156
00:32:02,00 --> 00:32:06,50
She hits her head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS157
00:32:23,00 --> 00:32:28,50
The thug flips SOMEONE's phone shut. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS158
00:32:27,00 --> 00:32:32,50
Outside, the thug makes a call. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS159
00:32:39,00 --> 00:32:50,50
Reaching his SUV, he ends the call and gets in. He sets down a newspaper article featuring SOMEONE's name and photo as the credited writer. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS160
00:32:47,00 --> 00:32:53,50
In his car, SOMEONE notices smoke wafting from the back. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS161
00:32:51,00 --> 00:33:02,50
Later, he pops the trunk. SOMEONE throws the flare aside and punches SOMEONE in the crotch. He chases her down the shoulder then tackles her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS162
00:32:59,00 --> 00:33:15,50
Now, In Atlantic City, a storefront sign reads, Souvenirs, SOMEONE's Gifts. The hulking goateed guy, SOMEONE, arrives sporting two black eyes and a gash across his nose He heads inside and lumbers to the rear. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS163
00:33:12,00 --> 00:33:23,50
He enters a dingy backroom where bookies work at stations along a table. As he arrives at a desk, an aging blonde swivels to face him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS164
00:33:29,00 --> 00:33:34,50
SOMEONE shifts his sheepish gaze. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS165
00:33:59,00 --> 00:34:06,50
At night at a gas station, SOMEONE sits handcuffed to SOMEONE's passenger door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS166
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:10,50
SOMEONE washes the windshield. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS167
00:34:38,00 --> 00:34:43,50
She gives a resigned shrug. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS168
00:35:02,00 --> 00:35:09,50
SOMEONE imagines Teresa chewing her gum and popping a bubble. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS169
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:36,50
He replaces the gas nozzle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS170
00:35:36,00 --> 00:35:41,50
He leans on his open window. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS171
00:35:42,00 --> 00:35:52,50
Later, Atlantic City's hotel casinos gleam in the night air. SOMEONE works his jaw driving his blue convertible past them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS172
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:05,50
She offers him a wad of cash. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS173
00:36:37,00 --> 00:36:41,50
She studies him skeptically. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS174
00:36:46,00 --> 00:36:50,50
She smells the cash. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS175
00:36:48,00 --> 00:36:53,50
SOMEONE pouts then licks his lips. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS176
00:36:50,00 --> 00:36:56,50
Later, he unlocks her handcuffs and lets her out of the car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS177
00:37:06,00 --> 00:37:13,50
Now, from his MINI Cooper, SOMEONE sees SOMEONE's car arrive at the Taj Mahal Casino. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS178
00:37:16,00 --> 00:37:20,50
With SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS179
00:37:32,00 --> 00:37:36,50
SOMEONE checks his phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS180
00:37:35,00 --> 00:37:39,50
He hits a button 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS181
00:37:41,00 --> 00:37:45,50
In the casino. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS182
00:38:17,00 --> 00:38:23,50
Now, SOMEONE drives into the Taj Mahal parking lot. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS183
00:38:20,00 --> 00:38:26,50
Out of his car, he creeps up alongside SOMEONE's Delta '88. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS184
00:38:24,00 --> 00:38:28,50
He knocks on the trunk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS185
00:38:31,00 --> 00:38:36,50
He presses an ear to the trunk and listens. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS186
00:38:39,00 --> 00:38:45,50
He opens the driver side door and pops the trunk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS187
00:38:43,00 --> 00:38:47,50
He finds it empty. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS188
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:52,50
SOMEONE looks on. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS189
00:38:49,00 --> 00:38:54,50
He points at the car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS190
00:39:12,00 --> 00:39:20,50
SOMEONE slams SOMEONE's head against the trunk. SOMEONE crumbles. Now, at a craps table, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS191
00:39:28,00 --> 00:39:32,50
he shows her the dice. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS192
00:39:38,00 --> 00:39:44,50
SOMEONE frowns. SOMEONE quirks his brow at her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS193
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:47,50
She reluctantly purses her lips and blows on the dice. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS194
00:39:46,00 --> 00:39:51,50
He rolls a seven. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS195
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:59,50
A croupier's hand nudges a tall stack of chips toward SOMEONE. Later, SOMEONE blows on the dice again. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS196
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:11,50
She gawks and SOMEONE points excitedly. The stickman returns the dice to him, a croupier adds two more stacks of chips to his winnings, and SOMEONE and SOMEONE both blow on the dice. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS197
00:40:08,00 --> 00:40:13,50
The bounty hunter rolls a seven. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS198
00:40:10,00 --> 00:40:15,50
SOMEONE fans herself nervously. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS199
00:40:12,00 --> 00:40:21,50
The croupier awards SOMEONE two more stacks. Now, SOMEONE blows on the dice repeatedly. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS200
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:24,50
SOMEONE cheers throwing her hands in the air. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS201
00:40:58,00 --> 00:41:02,50
She starts off. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS202
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:03,50
He grabs her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS203
00:41:12,00 --> 00:41:17,50
He shows the dice but she keeps her lips together. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS204
00:41:22,00 --> 00:41:28,50
The stickman eyes SOMEONE, who throws the dice. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS205
00:41:38,00 --> 00:41:42,50
He rolls. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS206
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:44,50
Later, in a hallway. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS207
00:42:01,00 --> 00:42:06,50
Now, they enter a spacious and eclectic suite. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS208
00:42:06,00 --> 00:42:11,50
SOMEONE weaves past boldly upholstered furniture. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS209
00:42:09,00 --> 00:42:15,50
She admires the chic lamps and mod accessories. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS210
00:42:47,00 --> 00:42:54,50
He cuffs her to the headboard, plops down their bags, and heads out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS211
00:42:54,00 --> 00:42:59,50
As he stalks out, she flings a vase after him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS212
00:42:59,00 --> 00:43:11,50
Trapped by the handcuffs, she plops onto the bed. SOMEONE struts out of the room and presses an elevator call button. He rubs his hands together then primps in a mirror. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS213
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:19,50
He boards the elevator, presses a button, and snaps open the check from Teresa. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS214
00:43:20,00 --> 00:43:34,50
He kisses it and the elevator closes. Later, it opens revealing a disheveled SOMEONE clutching a drink. His shirt half untucked and his collar sticking up, he staggers out and drains the glass. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS215
00:43:31,00 --> 00:43:44,50
Now he stumbles down the hall, leaning against a wall for support. The drunken man takes a rest then hobbles forward and bends over his door lock. He disappears inside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS216
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:54,50
In the bedroom, SOMEONE lies asleep. Her handcuffed arm leaning vertically against the headboard. SOMEONE eyes her, swaying, then sets his gun on the nightstand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS217
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:57,50
Later, on his side, he turns off the light. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS218
00:43:54,00 --> 00:44:03,50
He flops onto his back fully dressed and in his shoes and scooches around getting comfy. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS219
00:44:04,00 --> 00:44:10,50
Later, SOMEONE's eyes spring open. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS220
00:44:09,00 --> 00:44:20,50
Raising her brow, she looks around thoughtfully, then sits up and peeks over at SOMEONE. Just past him, she spots his gun on the nightstand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS221
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:23,50
SOMEONE lies on her back then rolls toward him, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS222
00:44:20,00 --> 00:44:27,50
sliding the handcuff along the top rail of the headboard. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS223
00:44:29,00 --> 00:44:37,50
She props herself up on her hands and knees then inches closer and reaches for the gun with her free hand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS224
00:44:34,00 --> 00:44:43,50
Her fingers fall short. She tips off balance but catches herself before landing on top of SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS225
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:50,50
SOMEONE braces herself on the headboard, digs her feet into the comforter, and makes her downward facing body as stiff as a board. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS226
00:44:48,00 --> 00:44:53,50
She carefully straddles SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS227
00:44:53,00 --> 00:44:58,50
He drowsily opens his eyes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS228
00:45:00,00 --> 00:45:04,50
She musters a smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS229
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:10,50
She playfully smacks the headboard. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS230
00:45:41,00 --> 00:45:46,50
She cranes her lips close to his. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS231
00:45:56,00 --> 00:46:01,50
He raises his gun in front of her face. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS232
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:04,50
She rears back. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS233
00:46:03,00 --> 00:46:07,50
She climbs off. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS234
00:46:09,00 --> 00:46:14,50
She turns her back to him and punches her pillow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS235
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:16,50
He eyes her, smiling. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS236
00:46:14,00 --> 00:46:24,50
Daytime. A mural on a slim, brick building bears SOMEONE's name. SOMEONE enters the back room with a pizza. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS237
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:31,50
SOMEONE raises a golf club to let Ray pass. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS238
00:46:29,00 --> 00:46:36,50
He leads SOMEONE into a grungy bathroom where SOMEONE sits handcuffed to a pipe. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS239
00:46:57,00 --> 00:47:02,50
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE the golf club. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS240
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:10,50
SOMEONE hits him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS241
00:47:29,00 --> 00:47:33,50
Now, in the suite. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS242
00:47:31,00 --> 00:47:36,50
SOMEONE finds herself alone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS243
00:47:34,00 --> 00:47:38,50
A maid enters. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS244
00:47:37,00 --> 00:47:42,50
She peeks into the bedroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS245
00:47:40,00 --> 00:47:44,50
SOMEONE glances at the handcuff. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS246
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:09,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE steps out of the shower, tucking a towel around his waist. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS247
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:16,50
In the bedroom, SOMEONE zips up SOMEONE's satchel. She tugs at the handcuff then hunkers down and winds up swinging the bag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS248
00:48:15,00 --> 00:48:19,50
She flings it across the room. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS249
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:22,50
It misses the ottoman and lands on the floor. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS250
00:48:23,00 --> 00:48:27,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE looks up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS251
00:48:25,00 --> 00:48:31,50
As he opens the door, SOMEONE lies down and mimes a yawn. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS252
00:48:35,00 --> 00:48:40,50
She sits up and looks around. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS253
00:48:42,00 --> 00:48:47,50
She points at the handcuff. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS254
00:48:48,00 --> 00:48:52,50
He unlocks her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS255
00:48:53,00 --> 00:49:01,50
Massaging her wrist, SOMEONE strides to the bathroom. She sees SOMEONE following her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS256
00:49:09,00 --> 00:49:14,50
He glances at her low-cut top then ogles her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS257
00:49:12,00 --> 00:49:18,50
She shrugs theatrically and enters the bathroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS258
00:49:15,00 --> 00:49:20,50
He steps up to the doors. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS259
00:49:21,00 --> 00:49:27,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's Taser from under her skirt. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS260
00:49:25,00 --> 00:49:29,50
She turns it on. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS262
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:53,50
She tasers him in the neck. SOMEONE convulses and crumples. SOMEONE skips over him and grabs her bag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS263
00:49:50,00 --> 00:49:56,50
Later, at the elevators, she presses the call button. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS264
00:49:53,00 --> 00:50:08,50
One opens behind her and she hurries aboard, shoes in hand. Another elevator opens and the chiseled thug strides out. He glimpses SOMEONE as her elevator closes. He quickly presses the call button. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS266
00:50:39,00 --> 00:50:45,50
as the thug searches for her a pedicab pulls up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS267
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:52,50
SOMEONE hops into the shaded seat. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS268
00:50:51,00 --> 00:50:56,50
They ride away. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS269
00:50:59,00 --> 00:51:04,50
SOMEONE looks in her bag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS270
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:14,50
The driver checks her out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS271
00:51:19,00 --> 00:51:25,50
SOMEONE looks off and gives a half-wince, half-smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS272
00:51:26,00 --> 00:51:32,50
Later, SOMEONE pedals the stolen pedicab by herself. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS273
00:51:36,00 --> 00:51:48,50
The teenager chases her on foot. She rides down a ramp. Now, in the hotel suite's bathroom, SOMEONE awakens on the floor. Holding his head, he sits up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS274
00:51:45,00 --> 00:52:00,50
Later, an aerial view shows his baby-blue Delta driving away from the Taj Mahal. Behind the wheel, SOMEONE eyes the two-inch red SOMEONE on his neck in the rear-view mirror then touches it and winces. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS275
00:51:58,00 --> 00:52:07,50
Now, SOMEONE struggles to pedal down a highway. Cringing, she leans wearily over the handlebars. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS276
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:12,50
SOMEONE spots the pedicab from a block behind and gives a vengeful smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS277
00:52:10,00 --> 00:52:16,50
SOMEONE spots him and scowls. She pedals faster. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS278
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:20,50
He drives up and taps the back of the pedicab with his bumper. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS279
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:22,50
SOMEONE gapes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS280
00:52:21,00 --> 00:52:40,50
SOMEONE accelerates and taps her again. Several other vehicles speed past them. SOMEONE drives up close behind her then backs off. SOMEONE pedals exhaustedly then halts, slumping. SOMEONE stops inches behind her then scoots forward and bumps the pedicab again. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS281
00:52:42,00 --> 00:52:49,50
SOMEONE sneers. A sedan passes them and she climbs off the bike. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS282
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:57,50
She grabs up her purse and glares at him, then stalks around to the passenger door and reaches for the handle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS283
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:58,50
SOMEONE backs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS284
00:53:05,00 --> 00:53:16,50
He shifts into park and raises both hands innocently. SOMEONE glances around. She treads back to the door, her eyes locked on SOMEONE's. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS285
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:20,50
As she reaches for the handle, the car lurches forward. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS286
00:53:26,00 --> 00:53:34,50
SOMEONE winces, stifling tears, then stares off. SOMEONE eyes her churlishly. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS287
00:53:33,00 --> 00:53:39,50
Her lips tighten and she shakes her head, looking skyward. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS288
00:53:39,00 --> 00:53:43,50
She claps a hand to her mouth. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS289
00:53:45,00 --> 00:53:50,50
SOMEONE glances away. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS290
00:53:47,00 --> 00:53:54,50
SOMEONE brushes her hair out of her face then sobs into her hand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS291
00:53:55,00 --> 00:54:01,50
He shifts the car into park, gets out, and faces his ex-wife. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS292
00:54:03,00 --> 00:54:09,50
She stays put. Her posture wounded and childlike. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS293
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:15,50
He knits his brow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS294
00:54:13,00 --> 00:54:19,50
SOMEONE tugs on the door handle, which sticks, then gives. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS295
00:54:16,00 --> 00:54:22,50
She climbs into the seat and slams the door shut. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS296
00:54:19,00 --> 00:54:26,50
SOMEONE looks over his shoulder and spots a billboard in a field. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS297
00:54:23,00 --> 00:54:32,50
It reads, Cupid's Cabin and shows a picture of a bed and breakfast in a Victorian style mansion. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS298
00:54:29,00 --> 00:54:34,50
The bounty hunter purses his lips. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS299
00:54:35,00 --> 00:54:40,50
He shuffles back alongside the car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS300
00:54:37,00 --> 00:54:47,50
In the passenger seat, SOMEONE wipes her eyes then rests her forehead on the back of her hand, hiding her face. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS301
00:54:44,00 --> 00:54:51,50
SOMEONE sheepishly opens his door and takes his seat at the wheel. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS302
00:54:48,00 --> 00:54:52,50
He glances at SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS303
00:54:50,00 --> 00:54:57,50
He backs the car away from the pedicab, steers around it, and drives off. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS304
00:54:54,00 --> 00:55:02,50
Now, SOMEONE leads an elderly man with fuzzy hair into the grungy bathroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS305
00:54:59,00 --> 00:55:04,50
SOMEONE rests his leg on the toilet. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS306
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:17,50
The man takes out a giant syringe. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS307
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:47,50
The vet jabs the needle into SOMEONE's neck. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS308
00:55:46,00 --> 00:55:54,50
Now, in SOMEONE's car, SOMEONE rides with one wrist cuffed to the door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS309
00:56:16,00 --> 00:56:23,50
SOMEONE spots a luxury pick-up in her side mirror then eyes it over her shoulder. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS310
00:56:27,00 --> 00:56:32,50
SOMEONE aims the rear-view mirror at it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS311
00:56:55,00 --> 00:57:00,50
The pick-up pulls up beside them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS312
00:56:58,00 --> 00:57:13,50
As the chiseled thug aims a gun at them from behind the wheel, SOMEONE jams her foot on the gas pedal. SOMEONE veers onto the shoulder, then into oncoming traffic on a one-way street. The thug shoots at them from the parallel two-way road. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS313
00:57:11,00 --> 00:57:28,50
Drawing his gun, SOMEONE returns fire. SOMEONE cowers. The pick-up swerves onto the one-way street and jams itself alongside the Delta, mangling the convertible's headlight and SOMEONE. The vehicles separate. SOMEONE bashes the pick-up and takes aim. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS314
00:57:27,00 --> 00:57:37,50
As they speed forward, shoving against each other, SOMEONE spots an SUV headed straight for the thug's vehicle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS315
00:57:35,00 --> 00:57:53,50
Swerving, the chiseled man bursts through construction barricades then ramps up a stack of barricades and launches into mid-air. The pick-up lands on its roof and skids across the two-lane road. Reaching a grassy field, it tumbles onto its side. SOMEONE pulls over. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS316
00:57:52,00 --> 00:57:57,50
She wrenches her cuffed arm. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS317
00:57:59,00 --> 00:58:04,50
He gets out and surveys the damage. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS318
00:58:02,00 --> 00:58:13,50
As SOMEONE jogs toward the luxury pick-up, the thug wriggles out through a window on the other side. Nearing he vehicle, SOMEONE slows and aims his gun. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS319
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:16,50
His assailant gets to his feet, using the pick-up as cover. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS320
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:25,50
The bounty hunter ventures toward the vehicles tail-end and the thug edges around its front. SOMEONE arrives on the other side and finds no sign of the gunman. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS321
00:58:23,00 --> 00:58:29,50
Turning back, he finds himself aiming at SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS322
00:58:26,00 --> 00:58:31,50
She clutches her door's broken-off inner panel. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS324
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:46,50
On the one way street, the thug yanks a woman from her mini-van, gets in, and speeds off. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS325
00:59:12,00 --> 00:59:16,50
SOMEONE gawks. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS326
00:59:56,00 --> 01:00:01,50
Later, they search the pick-up together. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS327
01:00:04,00 --> 01:00:08,50
He opens the covered bed. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS328
01:00:10,00 --> 01:00:14,50
He finds a golf bag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS329
01:00:15,00 --> 01:00:20,50
She hurls the cup at him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS330
01:00:22,00 --> 01:00:27,50
SOMEONE climbs out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS331
01:00:41,00 --> 01:00:46,50
SOMEONE notices a tag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS332
01:00:53,00 --> 01:01:08,50
SOMEONE glares then yields a smile. Now, SOMEONE's ragtop follows a winding road toward a mansion perched atop an immaculately landscaped hill. At the mansions entrance, they surrender the car to a valet. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS333
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:38,50
Inside, a pristinely quaffed woman works a reception desk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS334
01:01:42,00 --> 01:01:48,50
Her red painted lips primly stifle an excited smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS335
01:01:50,00 --> 01:01:54,50
They follow her through the lobby. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS336
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:07,50
The woman frowns. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS337
01:02:47,00 --> 01:02:52,50
The woman scowls suspiciously. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS338
01:02:51,00 --> 01:02:57,50
SOMEONE smiles tightly and SOMEONE shakes his head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS339
01:03:23,00 --> 01:03:29,50
The couple steps out back and wanders through a festive picnic. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS340
01:03:48,00 --> 01:03:53,50
He walks her to the party's edge. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS341
01:03:51,00 --> 01:03:55,50
They find some caddies. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS342
01:04:00,00 --> 01:04:05,50
One rumples his lips then flees. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS343
01:04:03,00 --> 01:04:07,50
He scurries down some steps. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS344
01:04:06,00 --> 01:04:10,50
SOMEONE gives chase. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS345
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:31,50
The caddy leads him down a hill and across a grassy driving range. The bounty hunter frantically dodges golf balls as they whiz toward him. He leaps over one then ducks another. One ball buzzes low over his head and a fourth whips past his nose. As he leaves the range and runs onto a green, SOMEONE drives up in a golf cart. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS346
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:51,50
Elsewhere, the caddy peeks out from a sunken sand trap. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS347
01:04:54,00 --> 01:04:59,50
The caddy crawls out from hiding. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS348
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:03,50
As he holds the flag for putting golfers, SOMEONE spies him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS349
01:05:00,00 --> 01:05:09,50
SOMEONE steers the cart in the caddy's direction. The young man spots them and his polite smile fades. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS350
01:05:08,00 --> 01:05:14,50
Dropping the flag, he dashes over a hill. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS351
01:05:11,00 --> 01:05:17,50
Cresting the rise, the cart speeds toward a pond. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS352
01:05:17,00 --> 01:05:23,50
SOMEONE leaps out, tackles the caddy, and tumbles with him into the water. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS353
01:05:20,00 --> 01:05:26,50
The out of control cart plunges in beside them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS354
01:05:37,00 --> 01:05:41,50
SOMEONE dunks him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS355
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:01,50
SOMEONE dunks him again. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS356
01:06:07,00 --> 01:06:12,50
He shows his tattooed chest. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS357
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:23,50
SOMEONE swaps looks with SOMEONE then releases the caddy. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS358
01:06:20,00 --> 01:06:25,50
Now, at the tattoo parlor. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS360
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:43,50
she pulls her hair back. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS361
01:06:54,00 --> 01:06:59,50
He plucks it from her neck. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS362
01:07:14,00 --> 01:07:19,50
SOMEONE digs out his cell and holds it up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS363
01:07:18,00 --> 01:07:22,50
He answers it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS364
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:46,50
SOMEONE frowns uneasily at SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS365
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:02,50
He ends the call. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS366
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:04,50
In the convertible 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS367
01:08:12,00 --> 01:08:19,50
at a turnoff, they pass a sign reading, Cupid's Cabin. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS368
01:08:16,00 --> 01:08:24,50
Later, they face a three-story Victorian style house with a wrap-around porch. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS369
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:39,50
A curly-haired woman answers the door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS370
01:08:46,00 --> 01:08:51,50
A chubby man arrives. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS371
01:09:14,00 --> 01:09:21,50
SOMEONE smiles sadly at SOMEONE, who gives a nostalgic nod. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS372
01:09:39,00 --> 01:09:44,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE muster smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS373
01:09:47,00 --> 01:09:53,50
SOMEONE stares, her features frozen in a thoughtful gape. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS374
01:11:05,00 --> 01:11:10,50
The older woman gawks. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS375
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:22,50
Nighttime. In frumpy clothes, SOMEONE and SOMEONE dine on a patio. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS376
01:11:51,00 --> 01:11:56,50
He eyes the adjoining building. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS377
01:11:54,00 --> 01:11:59,50
They share a warm smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS378
01:11:57,00 --> 01:12:04,50
SOMEONE drops her gaze, fiddling with her silky honey-brown hair. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS379
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:17,50
She shrugs a hand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS380
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:20,50
SOMEONE lifts his brow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS381
01:12:20,00 --> 01:12:25,50
Looking away, she shrugs again. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS382
01:12:40,00 --> 01:12:44,50
SOMEONE blinks at her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS383
01:12:53,00 --> 01:12:58,50
SOMEONE regards him thoughtfully. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS384
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:02,50
He gives a boyish half-smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS385
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:13,50
She raises her champagne glass. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS386
01:13:10,00 --> 01:13:14,50
SOMEONE follows suit. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS387
01:13:22,00 --> 01:13:30,50
They tap glasses. SOMEONE sips his sparkling wine with a knitted brow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS388
01:13:28,00 --> 01:13:34,50
SOMEONE's smile fades to a tight smirk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS389
01:14:19,00 --> 01:14:24,50
SOMEONE gives a sad shrug. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS390
01:14:21,00 --> 01:14:29,50
Resting her cheek against her hand, SOMEONE shakes her head and gazes skyward. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS391
01:14:53,00 --> 01:15:00,50
SOMEONE looks away then faces him defenselessly. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS392
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:11,50
SOMEONE tearfully tightens her lips. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS393
01:15:08,00 --> 01:15:15,50
Now, the two stroll down a hallway lit cheerily with glass-shaded lamps. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS394
01:15:13,00 --> 01:15:19,50
SOMEONE pauses to eye an inscription on one of the doors. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS395
01:15:16,00 --> 01:15:26,50
Reaching another door, they find a lavender heart-shaped sign that reads, Bliss in rosy cursive letters. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS396
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:31,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE chuckle at the frilly placard then share a warm lingering gaze. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS397
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:36,50
SOMEONE starts to open her mouth, then shakes her head and smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS398
01:15:35,00 --> 01:15:40,50
Staring at her intently, he nods. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS400
01:15:40,00 --> 01:15:47,50
As he unlocks the door, he steps in close and leans his face toward hers. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS401
01:15:50,00 --> 01:15:57,50
SOMEONE opens the door, revealing a narrow four-post bed on a lavender carpet. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS402
01:15:55,00 --> 01:16:01,50
Table lamps cast their soft glow against the rosy wall. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS403
01:15:58,00 --> 01:16:05,50
SOMEONE gestures her inside and SOMEONE precedes him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS404
01:16:02,00 --> 01:16:08,50
At the Borgata lounge, Kitty takes a phone call. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS406
01:16:36,00 --> 01:16:40,50
SOMEONE drops by. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS407
01:16:42,00 --> 01:16:46,50
SOMEONE accepts a tray. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS408
01:16:54,00 --> 01:17:00,50
Checking SOMEONE's wallet, he finds their wedding photo. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS409
01:16:58,00 --> 01:17:04,50
It shows SOMEONE and him beaming as bride and groom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS410
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:07,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, who waits in the hall. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS411
01:17:07,00 --> 01:17:11,50
He shuts the door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS412
01:17:09,00 --> 01:17:16,50
SOMEONE moves from the door, his eyes fixed on the photo, and his lips parted. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS414
01:17:52,00 --> 01:17:59,50
she slugs back an entire cocktail and gives a bracing twitch of the brow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS415
01:18:08,00 --> 01:18:12,50
SOMEONE and Teresa talk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS416
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:33,50
SOMEONE enters with his kids. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS417
01:18:40,00 --> 01:18:44,50
SOMEONE picks up the phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS418
01:19:10,00 --> 01:19:15,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS419
01:19:27,00 --> 01:19:31,50
SOMEONE hangs up then stares at her reflection in the mirror. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS422
01:19:44,00 --> 01:19:51,50
SOMEONE lights candles around the room and pops a CD into a player. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS423
01:19:56,00 --> 01:20:01,50
SOMEONE peeks out from the bathroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS424
01:20:07,00 --> 01:20:12,50
His back to SOMEONE, SOMEONE hangs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS425
01:20:09,00 --> 01:20:18,50
His ex-wife returns to the bathroom unnoticed. Now, she steps out wrapped tightly in a bathrobe. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS426
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:22,50
She avoids SOMEONE's gaze. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS427
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:29,50
Marching to the bed, she blows out a candle on a bedside table, turns off the CD player, and hurls some pillows to the floor. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS428
01:20:32,00 --> 01:20:38,50
She throws down more pillows until only a few remain. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS429
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:45,50
She blows out another candle and climbs under the covers. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS430
01:20:59,00 --> 01:21:11,50
Lying on her back, SOMEONE closes her eyes then sneakily peeks one open. She watches as SOMEONE blows out more candles. He snuffs the last one with his hand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS431
01:21:14,00 --> 01:21:23,50
He pops a candy into his mouth and climbs into bed fully clothed. He scoots up against SOMEONE and folds his arms. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS432
01:21:24,00 --> 01:21:31,50
SOMEONE eyes him as he chews. He glances over and she looks away. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS433
01:21:28,00 --> 01:21:33,50
He closes his eyes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS434
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:49,50
She climbs out of bed and grabs a blanket then swipes the pillow out from behind SOMEONE's head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS435
01:21:47,00 --> 01:21:51,50
He bumps the headboard. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS436
01:21:49,00 --> 01:21:57,50
As he winces, SOMEONE throws the pillow at his face. She settles onto a window bench. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS437
01:22:00,00 --> 01:22:06,50
Closing his eyes, SOMEONE folds his hands behind his head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS438
01:22:03,00 --> 01:22:09,50
From the bench, SOMEONE turns and glares at him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS439
01:22:06,00 --> 01:22:13,50
Later, she wears her own clothes as she slams the suite's door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS440
01:22:10,00 --> 01:22:16,50
SOMEONE stirs. He finds himself cuffed to the bed. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS441
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:26,50
SOMEONE jingles the handcuff keys. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS442
01:22:25,00 --> 01:22:29,50
She leaves. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS443
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:33,50
SOMEONE yanks on his cuff secured tightly to the headboard. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS444
01:22:32,00 --> 01:22:41,50
As SOMEONE races out the door, SOMEONE frantically yanks on the headboard. He breaks off the top and falls back onto the bed. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS445
01:22:39,00 --> 01:22:46,50
Now, as he rushes outside, SOMEONE pulls his car out of the drive. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS446
01:22:45,00 --> 01:22:52,50
Still attached to the headboard, he chases after her. The convertible speeds away. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS447
01:22:50,00 --> 01:22:56,50
He watches as it disappears around a corner. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS448
01:22:54,00 --> 01:23:00,50
Meanwhile, at a gas station, SOMEONE opens his trunk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS449
01:22:58,00 --> 01:23:05,50
He plucks a SOMEONE from the garbage bag full of cash and heads toward a convenient store. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS450
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:21,50
SOMEONE halts, gives Ray the finger, and steps into the store. Ray spots SOMEONE's car as it rides by. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS452
01:23:32,00 --> 01:23:38,50
At cupid's cabin, as SOMEONE stands on the front stoop, SOMEONE shuts the door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS453
01:23:35,00 --> 01:23:45,50
SOMEONE watches as a black luxury sedan pulls up to the porch steps. A young couple climbs out and he approaches the driver. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS454
01:23:47,00 --> 01:23:54,50
As the couple heads up the front steps, SOMEONE climbs into the car and peels out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS455
01:23:52,00 --> 01:24:09,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE drives SOMEONE's car. She spots a storefront with a Pink awning. Its psychedelic sign reads, Blue Ink Tattoos. Now, inside the tattoo parlor, SOMEONE strolls to the counter where a woman with a Mohawk and multiple piercings works. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS456
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:15,50
The woman glances at her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS457
01:24:15,00 --> 01:24:19,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS458
01:24:33,00 --> 01:24:38,50
A bald tattoo artist eyes SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS459
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:41,50
She struts toward him, hand on her hip. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS460
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:49,50
She grabs her breasts. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS461
01:24:54,00 --> 01:24:59,50
She frames her pelvis with her hands. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS462
01:24:57,00 --> 01:25:03,50
She runs a hand down her thigh then pats it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS463
01:25:01,00 --> 01:25:06,50
The tattoo artist eyes SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS464
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:10,50
SOMEONE turns to the tatted clerk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS465
01:25:09,00 --> 01:25:16,50
Now, SOMEONE sits in a chair in a small room papered in tattoo designs. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS466
01:25:14,00 --> 01:25:18,50
He draws a curtain. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS467
01:25:24,00 --> 01:25:28,50
SOMEONE sits. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS468
01:25:31,00 --> 01:25:35,50
SOMEONE's eyes widen. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS469
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:40,50
Sitting beside her, SOMEONE leans back and smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS470
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:53,50
With a wave, SOMEONE hurries through the parlor. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS471
01:25:50,00 --> 01:25:58,50
Brushing her hair out of her face, she peers over her shoulder then casually heads to the bathroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS472
01:25:55,00 --> 01:26:13,50
She opens the door, steps inside, and waits briefly. Glancing around, she creeps out of the bathroom and makes her way up some stairs. Now, she opens a door to a wood-paneled entry way. She cautiously checks over her shoulder then tiptoes inside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS473
01:26:10,00 --> 01:26:20,50
Seen through another doorway, an office chair sits at a desk with a giant mural of a snarling tiger behind it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS474
01:26:17,00 --> 01:26:23,50
A red and black bowling shirt hangs on the back of the chair. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS475
01:26:20,00 --> 01:26:25,50
SOMEONE scurries into the office. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS476
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:31,50
She sifts through a stack of paperwork then sits at the desk and rifles through files and drawers. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS477
01:26:28,00 --> 01:26:39,50
Swiveling in the chair, she spots a framed photo of a bowling team. In it, SOMEONE and SOMEONE pose with two teammates. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS478
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:44,50
A caption reads, Police Bowling League. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS479
01:26:43,00 --> 01:26:50,50
SOMEONE looks around then sets the photo back on a trophy shelf. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS480
01:26:50,00 --> 01:27:05,50
Scanning the office, she follows the sound around a corner and finds a louvered door locked by a deadbolt. She undoes the lock, opens the door, and finds SOMEONE inside. His mouth and wrists duct taped. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS481
01:27:07,00 --> 01:27:12,50
Downstairs, SOMEONE enters. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS482
01:27:13,00 --> 01:27:20,50
Upstairs, SOMEONE cuts tape binding SOMEONE's wrists. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS483
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:38,50
SOMEONE leads SOMEONE out a side door then rushes back in, grabs the bowling photo, and hurries out. SOMEONE enters through the front door, spots the open closet, and draws his gun. Looking inside, he finds it empty. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS485
01:27:44,00 --> 01:27:50,50
They race down the street. Meanwhile, SOMEONE makes a call. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS487
01:27:56,00 --> 01:28:01,50
they get in SOMEONE's car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS488
01:27:58,00 --> 01:28:03,50
SOMEONE's thugs sit in back. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS489
01:28:17,00 --> 01:28:21,50
They brandish their guns. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS490
01:28:20,00 --> 01:28:24,50
SOMEONE shrugs at SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS491
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:32,50
As SOMEONE scrambles out, SOMEONE gawks. With a parting glance, SOMEONE sprints away. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS492
01:28:34,00 --> 01:28:55,50
SOMEONE frowns at Ray. SOMEONE lets his head lull back. Now, SOMEONE spies his car in a nearby parking lot. He pulls in. A mural of two widespread female legs flanks the hot-pink back door of a strip club named, Double D's. SOMEONE climbs out of the borrowed car, satchel in hand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS493
01:28:52,00 --> 01:28:58,50
He checks his phone and flips it open. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS494
01:29:16,00 --> 01:29:21,50
SOMEONE approaches a purple and white muscle car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS495
01:29:27,00 --> 01:29:33,50
Inside the strip club, SOMEONE eyes his phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS496
01:29:31,00 --> 01:29:37,50
Outside, SOMEONE shoots the lock of SOMEONE's trunk and opens it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS497
01:29:34,00 --> 01:29:40,50
He finds the garbage bag of cash inside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS498
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:50,50
He answers his phone and casually leans on the open trunk lid. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS499
01:29:58,00 --> 01:30:03,50
He slings the garbage bag over his shoulder. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS500
01:30:11,00 --> 01:30:16,50
SOMEONE enters the club. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS501
01:30:34,00 --> 01:30:39,50
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE the cell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS502
01:30:51,00 --> 01:30:57,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE with her captors and hangs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS503
01:31:04,00 --> 01:31:11,50
SOMEONE watches as the two thugs escort his ex-wife through the strip club. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS504
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:15,50
They stop at a neon restroom sign and she heads inside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS505
01:31:12,00 --> 01:31:17,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE's shoulders sag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS506
01:31:17,00 --> 01:31:25,50
Across the club, SOMEONE watches the thugs unnoticed. He answers his phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS508
01:31:36,00 --> 01:31:42,50
Outside the restroom, SOMEONE tosses cash at some patrons. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS509
01:31:47,00 --> 01:31:53,50
SOMEONE hurls cash at the dancers onstage. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS510
01:31:53,00 --> 01:32:07,50
As SOMEONE tosses bills to patrons and employees, the thugs try to grab the cash from their hands. SOMEONE empties the garbage bag on a pool table then runs onstage with more money. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS511
01:32:06,00 --> 01:32:12,50
SOMEONE pushes people from the pool table. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS512
01:32:11,00 --> 01:32:18,50
He punches a guy. SOMEONE finds SOMEONE in the restroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS513
01:32:20,00 --> 01:32:24,50
A brawl breaks out in the club. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS515
01:33:07,00 --> 01:33:12,50
Back in the bathroom, SOMEONE stares wistfully. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS516
01:33:13,00 --> 01:33:24,50
He leads her through the chaos. At the pool table a formidable pole dancer piggy-backs SOMEONE. As Ray shoves her off, she grabs a bottle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS517
01:33:23,00 --> 01:33:29,50
The woman smashes it on SOMEONE's head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS518
01:33:27,00 --> 01:33:33,50
He falls. Ray faces the dancer. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS519
01:33:33,00 --> 01:33:37,50
She knocks him out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS520
01:33:34,00 --> 01:33:39,50
Now, in the police department. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS521
01:34:18,00 --> 01:34:25,50
In the ragtop, SOMEONE ends the call and glances at SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS522
01:34:39,00 --> 01:34:53,50
The convertible speeds down a street and through an intersection. Now, in the depository building, SOMEONE packs evidence baggies filled with white powder into a brown paper bag then rolls the top down. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS523
01:34:51,00 --> 01:34:58,50
Outside, the Delta '88 sits parked across the street. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS524
01:36:17,00 --> 01:36:25,50
A dark sedan drives around the corner of the depository and pulls into a parking spot. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS525
01:36:22,00 --> 01:36:26,50
SOMEONE's at the wheel. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS526
01:36:23,00 --> 01:36:27,50
SOMEONE slumps. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS527
01:36:32,00 --> 01:36:39,50
They lock gazes then watch SOMEONE enter the depository. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS528
01:36:36,00 --> 01:36:41,50
Inside, SOMEONE exits a freight elevator. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS529
01:36:47,00 --> 01:36:52,50
SOMEONE shifts his confused stare. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS530
01:36:50,00 --> 01:36:59,50
Downstairs, SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter through a main door. A clerk behind a cage-wire barrier addresses them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS532
01:37:08,00 --> 01:37:13,50
SOMEONE sets the paper bag down. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS533
01:37:11,00 --> 01:37:17,50
The men shoot at each other. SOMEONE grabs the clerk through a window. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS534
01:37:16,00 --> 01:37:23,50
The clerk hits a button on his desk. SOMEONE opens a nearby gate. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS535
01:37:21,00 --> 01:37:33,50
SOMEONE releases the clerk, who grabs a phone. Now, SOMEONE creeps up a stairwell, his gun drawn. SOMEONE follows. Later, they exit the stairwell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS536
01:37:30,00 --> 01:37:36,50
SOMEONE fearfully trots up and hides behind SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS537
01:37:35,00 --> 01:37:41,50
He glares toward her feet and she mouths, Sorry. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS538
01:37:38,00 --> 01:37:45,50
As SOMEONE surveys their surroundings, SOMEONE takes cover behind a pillar. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS539
01:37:42,00 --> 01:37:47,50
He irritably waves her over. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS540
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:54,50
A view through tall shelving units crammed with evidence shows the couple prowl forward. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS541
01:37:51,00 --> 01:37:58,50
As they sneak, SOMEONE taps SOMEONE's shoulder and he wheels around with his gun. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS542
01:37:59,00 --> 01:38:12,50
Blood stains the freight elevator and they glimpse a fallen man's feet. As SOMEONE skulks off, SOMEONE and SOMEONE slink toward the elevator and find SOMEONE bleeding inside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS543
01:38:09,00 --> 01:38:13,50
They hurry over. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS544
01:38:25,00 --> 01:38:30,50
SOMEONE swaps looks with SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS545
01:38:36,00 --> 01:38:43,50
SOMEONE stalks off, gun raised. Back in the elevator, SOMEONE looks to SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS546
01:38:51,00 --> 01:38:56,50
SOMEONE glares at him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS547
01:38:53,00 --> 01:39:00,50
Out among the industrial shelves, SOMEONE creeps past aisles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS548
01:38:57,00 --> 01:39:04,50
SOMEONE hides at the end of one unit and watches SOMEONE creeping by. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS550
01:39:08,00 --> 01:39:14,50
Back in the elevator, SOMEONE points at SOMEONE insistently then creeps out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS551
01:39:11,00 --> 01:39:17,50
In the depository, SOMEONE prowls down an aisle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS552
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:21,50
He aims his gun around a corner and scans the vacant shadows. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS553
01:39:18,00 --> 01:39:25,50
SOMEONE minces up to a shelving unit and peeks around it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS554
01:39:22,00 --> 01:39:28,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE ducks low then skulks forward. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS555
01:39:26,00 --> 01:39:35,50
SOMEONE sidles down an aisle, grabs SOMEONE's shoulder, and jabs his gun against the bounty hunter's neck. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS556
01:39:33,00 --> 01:39:40,50
Hidden, SOMEONE spots them. SOMEONE drops his gun. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS557
01:39:39,00 --> 01:39:45,50
SOMEONE mouths, Oh God and searches the shelves around her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS558
01:40:02,00 --> 01:40:18,50
SOMEONE spots a pair of evidence boxes. One labeled, Gotti, K and the other Gotti, V. A long flat box beneath them reads handle with care. As SOMEONE kneels, SOMEONE finds an outline of a shotgun printed on top. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS559
01:40:18,00 --> 01:40:22,50
SOMEONE takes aim. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS560
01:40:23,00 --> 01:40:28,50
SOMEONE grins. SOMEONE fumes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS561
01:40:27,00 --> 01:40:33,50
She blows a box to pieces. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS562
01:40:32,00 --> 01:40:39,50
As SOMEONE turns to shoot, SOMEONE sweeps his legs. SOMEONE misses. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS563
01:40:39,00 --> 01:40:47,50
Punched repeatedly, SOMEONE collapses. SOMEONE kicks his weapon away from him then glances at SOMEONE. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS564
01:40:44,00 --> 01:40:52,50
Daytime, outside. Dozens of police cruisers surround the depository. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS565
01:41:38,00 --> 01:41:42,50
She kisses SOMEONE's cheek. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS566
01:41:41,00 --> 01:41:49,50
As she leaves she takes a call from SOMEONE, who limps between a warehouse and an empty lot. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS567
01:42:37,00 --> 01:42:42,50
SOMEONE drops. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS568
01:42:44,00 --> 01:42:48,50
SOMEONE hangs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS569
01:42:45,00 --> 01:42:50,50
Later, in SOMEONE's ragtop, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS570
01:42:54,00 --> 01:42:59,50
a sly grin spreads across SOMEONE's lips. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS571
01:43:29,00 --> 01:43:36,50
She and SOMEONE swap warm smiles. Sunlight bathes her face. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS572
01:43:38,00 --> 01:43:46,50
SOMEONE beams. SOMEONE skids around a corner, pulls into a curbside spot, and brakes hard. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS573
01:43:47,00 --> 01:43:53,50
She notices the police station across the street. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS574
01:43:51,00 --> 01:43:55,50
SOMEONE gets out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS576
01:44:03,00 --> 01:44:08,50
In the station, SOMEONE wears handcuffs. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS577
01:44:17,00 --> 01:44:29,50
A female officer leads SOMEONE away as she glares at SOMEONE. The bounty hunter signs a form and the cop at the desk shakes his head incredulously. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS578
01:44:30,00 --> 01:44:38,50
Pursing his mouth regretfully, SOMEONE waves goodbye to the cop and ambles out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS579
01:44:43,00 --> 01:44:55,50
Now, SOMEONE strolls outside passing an officer and handcuffed teen on their way in. As the bounty hunter descends the stoop, the arresting officer from the parade swaggers up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS580
01:44:59,00 --> 01:45:04,50
SOMEONE eyes him with a half-smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS581
01:45:07,00 --> 01:45:13,50
SOMEONE punches him. Inside, SOMEONE uses a phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS582
01:45:18,00 --> 01:45:23,50
Gelman shoves a cuffed SOMEONE toward a holding cell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS583
01:45:35,00 --> 01:45:47,50
The officers place the couple in side-by-side cells. SOMEONE shrugs and faces his ex-wife through the bars. SOMEONE beams at him and shakes her head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS584
01:45:48,00 --> 01:45:53,50
They share a smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS585
01:45:52,00 --> 01:46:00,50
They step up to the bars. SOMEONE reaches through them and wraps her arms around SOMEONE's neck. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS586
01:45:57,00 --> 01:46:02,50
They kiss passionately. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS587
01:45:59,00 --> 01:46:07,50
SOMEONE strokes her ex-husband's hair then cups the back of his head in both her hands. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS588
01:46:04,00 --> 01:46:10,50
Separating, they gaze into each other's eyes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS589
01:46:13,00 --> 01:46:21,50
Grinning, SOMEONE massages his neck then wraps her arms around him once again. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS590
01:46:18,00 --> 01:46:23,50
They embrace and share a deep kiss. 

BURLESQUE_DVS26
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:50,50
Later as the blonde packs a suitcase, the sexy dancers pump their hips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS27
00:02:47,00 --> 00:02:52,50
The blonde regards a framed photo of a woman. 

BURLESQUE_DVS28
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:57,50
She sings in the empty dive. 

BURLESQUE_DVS29
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:01,50
She leaves the trailer park behind. 

BURLESQUE_DVS32
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:20,50
At a bus station. 

BURLESQUE_DVS33
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:33,50
Now she peers dreamily out the window of a cruising bus. 

BURLESQUE_DVS34
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:42,50
As the sequined-clad dancers command their stage, the blonde sings to empty chairs in SOMEONE's bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS35
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:58,50
Now the Hollywood sign fills the screen. On the bus, the sleepy blonde opens her eyes just as the sign's reflection skates across her window. 

BURLESQUE_DVS36
00:03:55,00 --> 00:04:08,50
Later in a run-down room at the old redbrick Hotel Rosslyn, she opens her suitcase. Other views show the glitzy athletic dancers in unison, then the blonde rocking out in SOMEONE's empty bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS37
00:04:06,00 --> 00:04:12,50
Now the blonde seals her stash of money inside a plastic bag. 

BURLESQUE_DVS38
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:19,50
In the bathroom, she lifts the lid off the toilet tank and carefully sets the bag inside, leaving its top edge over the back rim. 

BURLESQUE_DVS39
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:21,50
She replaces the porcelain lid. 

BURLESQUE_DVS40
00:04:18,00 --> 00:04:23,50
Now she unpacks her framed photo. 

BURLESQUE_DVS41
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:39,50
The blonde gazes fondly at the photo, which shows the brunette woman cradling a young girl. 

BURLESQUE_DVS42
00:04:37,00 --> 00:04:43,50
Now the newcomer to LA sits at a desk with a postcard of the old hotel. 

BURLESQUE_DVS43
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:45,50
She counts up several windows, 

BURLESQUE_DVS44
00:04:42,00 --> 00:04:47,50
She marks one specifically, and labels it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS46
00:04:45,00 --> 00:04:50,50
She flips the postcard. Her pen tip hovers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS47
00:04:48,00 --> 00:04:52,50
Then she rips the card to shreds. 

BURLESQUE_DVS48
00:04:50,00 --> 00:04:56,50
At her open window, she tosses the scraps and watches them flutter downward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS49
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:03,50
Now she steps onto a busy sidewalk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS50
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:08,50
She lifts her gaze from an issue of Back Stage Magazine in her hand and finds a sign for Hollywood Boulevard. 

BURLESQUE_DVS51
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:13,50
Her finger trails down an ad in the magazine that seeks background singers for urban group. 

BURLESQUE_DVS52
00:05:11,00 --> 00:05:17,50
At a street corner, a set of signs marks Hollywood and Vine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS53
00:05:14,00 --> 00:05:20,50
Our view sweeps up the towering circular Capitol Records building. 

BURLESQUE_DVS54
00:05:18,00 --> 00:05:25,50
The blonde enters another building, then exits and crosses off the ad in her paper. 

BURLESQUE_DVS55
00:05:22,00 --> 00:05:30,50
Later still, she Xs out two more ads for singers and dancers as she continues down the boulevard. 

BURLESQUE_DVS56
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:34,50
She gives someone a polite smile, which instantly fades as she moves on. 

BURLESQUE_DVS57
00:05:32,00 --> 00:05:37,50
Golden sunlight dwindles on the LA skyline. 

BURLESQUE_DVS58
00:05:35,00 --> 00:05:39,50
Fade to black. 

BURLESQUE_DVS59
00:05:41,00 --> 00:05:46,50
In the evening, the blonde strolls a busy street. 

BURLESQUE_DVS60
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:48,50
Her eyes sweeping her surroundings, 

BURLESQUE_DVS61
00:05:45,00 --> 00:05:50,50
she stops at an eye-catching archway. 

BURLESQUE_DVS62
00:05:48,00 --> 00:05:53,50
Flashing light bulbs arc over a gleaming sign, 

BURLESQUE_DVS63
00:05:50,00 --> 00:05:54,50
Burlesque Lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS64
00:05:52,00 --> 00:06:00,50
On the building's fire escape, she sees a woman in a sexy corset with a short feathery skirt. 

BURLESQUE_DVS65
00:05:57,00 --> 00:06:05,50
As the woman adjusts her striped thigh-highs, her gaze meets the blonde's. They share a smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS66
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:08,50
A bald man with a cigarette between his lips emerges from the building. 

BURLESQUE_DVS67
00:06:11,00 --> 00:06:16,50
The blonde heads toward the burlesque lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS68
00:06:13,00 --> 00:06:21,50
Our view sweeps up a nearly completed high-rise behind her that advertises, Luxury Condos for Sale. 

BURLESQUE_DVS69
00:06:19,00 --> 00:06:24,50
The blonde checks out a poster outside the lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS70
00:06:22,00 --> 00:06:29,50
It shows a pixie-faced blue-eyed brunette and reads, The Best View on the Sunset Strip. 

BURLESQUE_DVS73
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:38,50
Entering the building, the blonde makes her way down a dim wood-paneled hall. 

BURLESQUE_DVS74
00:06:36,00 --> 00:06:42,50
As she heads down a staircase, she eyes the lounge's stage through a window. 

BURLESQUE_DVS75
00:06:46,00 --> 00:06:55,50
Onstage, cool-blue light bathes dancers in skimpy sailor-themed outfits as they strike provocative poses. 

BURLESQUE_DVS76
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:03,50
A doorman holds out his hand. 

BURLESQUE_DVS77
00:07:12,00 --> 00:07:21,50
Onstage, six captivating dancers - three on a platform, three in front - scoop their hips and twirl their hands. They point skyward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS78
00:07:25,00 --> 00:07:33,50
The blonde opens her wallet and hesitates. She casts another glance at the show, then hands over a $20. 

BURLESQUE_DVS79
00:07:34,00 --> 00:07:40,50
Onstage, the reclined dancers snap then raise their arms in the air. 

BURLESQUE_DVS81
00:07:38,00 --> 00:07:44,50
Behind them, a woman with dark curly hair and high cheek bones faces us. 

BURLESQUE_DVS82
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:46,50
She wears a low-cut black unitard with tails and fuchsia lapels. 

BURLESQUE_DVS84
00:08:13,00 --> 00:08:18,50
The dancers rise and strut around the singer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS85
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:37,50
The dancers tap their heels, then nod to a neighboring stage where musicians play. One-by-one the dancers face the audience. 

BURLESQUE_DVS86
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:41,50
They pump their chests. 

BURLESQUE_DVS87
00:08:44,00 --> 00:08:51,50
The mesmerized blonde watches as varying dancers respond to their names. 

BURLESQUE_DVS88
00:09:13,00 --> 00:09:22,50
An auburn-haired dancer waves coyly. Now all of the dancers curl their fingers at us, beckoning mischievously. 

BURLESQUE_DVS89
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:51,50
The dancers squat. 

BURLESQUE_DVS90
00:09:52,00 --> 00:10:01,50
The dancers strike alluring seductive poses and line up downstage. One lifts a leg higher than the singer's head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS91
00:10:09,00 --> 00:10:14,50
The posed dancers frame the smiling diva. 

BURLESQUE_DVS92
00:10:12,00 --> 00:10:17,50
Tears in her eyes, the blonde woman claps, transfixed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS93
00:10:15,00 --> 00:10:25,50
As the band plays, a spotlight shines on dancers in silver-sequined outfits. A handsome toned bartender in eyeliner and a bowler hat leans toward the blonde. 

BURLESQUE_DVS94
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:44,50
They swap a smile. Then she returns her eyes to the stage where the dancers shake their hips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS95
00:10:41,00 --> 00:10:47,50
The bartender interrupts a pink-haired waitress who's busy flirting. 

BURLESQUE_DVS96
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:54,50
The blonde turns back to the bartender. 

BURLESQUE_DVS97
00:10:54,00 --> 00:10:59,50
She points to the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS98
00:11:10,00 --> 00:11:15,50
He hands her a business card. 

BURLESQUE_DVS99
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:20,50
As she leaves, the bartender smiles. Now the blonde enters a bustling backstage area. 

BURLESQUE_DVS100
00:11:18,00 --> 00:11:27,50
A dancer bumps into her as she hurries past. The blonde sees another dancer pulling on a sparkling garter over black stockings. 

BURLESQUE_DVS101
00:11:27,00 --> 00:11:37,50
Two dancers wear light-satin corsets with black spirals at the breasts. The blonde visitor finds the bald stage manager conferring with the diva. 

BURLESQUE_DVS102
00:12:06,00 --> 00:12:10,50
The naysayer faces the singer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS103
00:12:37,00 --> 00:12:42,50
As SOMEONE does the dancer's hair, the blonde approaches. 

BURLESQUE_DVS104
00:12:41,00 --> 00:12:47,50
She finds SOMEONE applying makeup at a mirror and leans over her shoulder. 

BURLESQUE_DVS105
00:13:29,00 --> 00:13:34,50
The eager woman slouches sadly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS106
00:13:32,00 --> 00:13:38,50
On her way out, she collides with the brunette in large sunglasses. 

BURLESQUE_DVS107
00:13:55,00 --> 00:13:59,50
She shows her nails. 

BURLESQUE_DVS108
00:14:11,00 --> 00:14:18,50
As the pixie-faced dancer brushes on blush, the blonde tilts her head at her. SOMEONE glances over. 

BURLESQUE_DVS109
00:14:31,00 --> 00:14:36,50
As she leaves, Jesse reaches for SOMEONE's makeup. 

BURLESQUE_DVS110
00:14:39,00 --> 00:14:48,50
Now, the young hopeful from Iowa sees the pink-haired waitress snubbing a customer. So she doffs her brown-leather jacket and grabs an empty tray from the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS111
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:54,50
She walks out among the tables. Collecting empty glasses, the ambitious girl starts taking drink orders. 

BURLESQUE_DVS112
00:14:59,00 --> 00:15:04,50
As she brings the tray back to the bar, SOMEONE notices her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS113
00:15:13,00 --> 00:15:24,50
The image revolves, framed in light bulbs like a dressing-room mirror. Now in black hot pants, the young hopeful collects a spent glass and draws a smile from SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS114
00:15:21,00 --> 00:15:30,50
Onstage, SOMEONE slides down beaded strands forming a curtain. In a black bra and panties, she lands in a split. 

BURLESQUE_DVS115
00:15:39,00 --> 00:15:45,50
As the girl from Iowa serves drinks, SOMEONE notices her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS116
00:16:08,00 --> 00:16:12,50
She gestures for the young woman to come over. 

BURLESQUE_DVS117
00:16:27,00 --> 00:16:32,50
SOMEONE sits back down beside SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS118
00:16:36,00 --> 00:16:40,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE swap smiles. 

BURLESQUE_DVS119
00:16:38,00 --> 00:16:44,50
SOMEONE windmills a leg, then seizes a bracelet off of Jesse. 

BURLESQUE_DVS120
00:16:43,00 --> 00:16:49,50
SOMEONE mimics a dance step, then resumes her work. 

BURLESQUE_DVS121
00:16:46,00 --> 00:16:51,50
SOMEONE leads four dancers downstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS122
00:16:54,00 --> 00:16:59,50
Now a rugged man gets SOMEONE's attention. 

BURLESQUE_DVS123
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:10,50
He slides her his AmEx. 

BURLESQUE_DVS124
00:17:12,00 --> 00:17:16,50
She looks back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS126
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:21,50
SOMEONE smirks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS127
00:17:19,00 --> 00:17:27,50
SOMEONE pushes the beads aside. She sees SOMEONE performing, then SOMEONE waiting tables. 

BURLESQUE_DVS128
00:17:35,00 --> 00:17:39,50
She dons a white stole. 

BURLESQUE_DVS129
00:17:39,00 --> 00:17:44,50
The curtain parts and SOMEONE struts into the limelight. 

BURLESQUE_DVS130
00:17:44,00 --> 00:17:51,50
She passes her stole to SOMEONE, who pitches it and competitively joins SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS131
00:17:48,00 --> 00:17:55,50
They swipe kitty paws at each other, then take turns upstaging each other. 

BURLESQUE_DVS132
00:17:52,00 --> 00:17:59,50
Entranced, SOMEONE flourishes a hand in front of a customer's face. 

BURLESQUE_DVS133
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:04,50
Now the dancers drum their hips. SOMEONE taps SOMEONE's nose. Then they trade phrases. 

BURLESQUE_DVS134
00:18:18,00 --> 00:18:25,50
At the bar, SOMEONE imagines herself performing, showered by silver confetti. 

BURLESQUE_DVS135
00:18:36,00 --> 00:18:41,50
She flings away her serving tray. 

BURLESQUE_DVS136
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:48,50
She twirls a string of diamonds overhead. 

BURLESQUE_DVS137
00:18:50,00 --> 00:19:02,50
Standing on a fringed pedestal surrounded by dancers, she coils the strand around her wrist. Snapping to, she gazes longingly at the performance. SOMEONE shoves SOMEONE offstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS138
00:19:01,00 --> 00:19:05,50
She opens her arms to the crowd. 

BURLESQUE_DVS139
00:19:06,00 --> 00:19:09,50
SOMEONE taps her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS140
00:19:19,00 --> 00:19:28,50
While SOMEONE chats at Marcus' table, SOMEONE peers over his glasses. SOMEONE glances at the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS141
00:19:36,00 --> 00:19:44,50
He slides her a tray of drinks. Now a stack of burlesque-related books lands on her hotel bed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS142
00:19:41,00 --> 00:19:50,50
SOMEONE lies on her stomach, flipping through photos of famed performers. At the lounge, she studies the dancers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS143
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:53,50
Lying on her back, she rests another book on her chest. 

BURLESQUE_DVS144
00:19:50,00 --> 00:19:56,50
We glimpse the Burlesque Lounge sign. Then SOMEONE and SOMEONE at work. 

BURLESQUE_DVS145
00:19:54,00 --> 00:20:00,50
As she serves a drink, the bartender eyes her and rubs his unshaven cheek. 

BURLESQUE_DVS146
00:19:58,00 --> 00:20:03,50
Now a soundman preps a vocal CD. 

BURLESQUE_DVS147
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:06,50
Sitting on the edge of the stage, SOMEONE crosses her legs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS148
00:20:15,00 --> 00:20:20,50
SOMEONE looks on with a tray of empty glasses. 

BURLESQUE_DVS149
00:20:43,00 --> 00:20:49,50
An overhead light shines down on three sexy nurses at an exam chair. 

BURLESQUE_DVS150
00:20:47,00 --> 00:20:53,50
In a lace bodysuit, SOMEONE stands and rocks her hips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS151
00:20:51,00 --> 00:20:56,50
Now in SOMEONE' office. 

BURLESQUE_DVS152
00:21:00,00 --> 00:21:04,50
SOMEONE looks on. 

BURLESQUE_DVS153
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:06,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a document. 

BURLESQUE_DVS154
00:21:32,00 --> 00:21:36,50
He grins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS155
00:22:08,00 --> 00:22:14,50
SOMEONE paces to a framed photo of her burlesque troupe. 

BURLESQUE_DVS156
00:22:11,00 --> 00:22:16,50
The picture reflects her porcelain complexion. 

BURLESQUE_DVS157
00:22:13,00 --> 00:22:18,50
As SOMEONE waits, she regards him plainly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS158
00:22:28,00 --> 00:22:32,50
In the hall, SOMEONE overhears. 

BURLESQUE_DVS159
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:44,50
SOMEONE leaves. SOMEONE turns on his way out. 

BURLESQUE_DVS160
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:51,50
Onstage, the nurses roll SOMEONE along in the chair. 

BURLESQUE_DVS161
00:22:54,00 --> 00:22:58,50
She rises to her knees. 

BURLESQUE_DVS162
00:22:57,00 --> 00:23:01,50
A nurse eyes the crowd. 

BURLESQUE_DVS163
00:23:12,00 --> 00:23:21,50
SOMEONE watches her and SOMEONE looks up from pouring a drink. With a dramatic swoon, SOMEONE wipes her brow and lies back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS164
00:23:18,00 --> 00:23:25,50
Later a bartender pours two tequila shots. In the dressing room, the dancers fix their makeup. 

BURLESQUE_DVS165
00:23:27,00 --> 00:23:31,50
SOMEONE sets down her tray. 

BURLESQUE_DVS166
00:23:35,00 --> 00:23:39,50
SOMEONE picks up the shot glasses. 

BURLESQUE_DVS167
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:47,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch her down both shots. 

BURLESQUE_DVS168
00:23:54,00 --> 00:23:59,50
SOMEONE joins SOMEONE at a costume rack. 

BURLESQUE_DVS170
00:24:55,00 --> 00:24:59,50
SOMEONE glances back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS171
00:24:59,00 --> 00:25:03,50
SOMEONE peers through the rack. 

BURLESQUE_DVS172
00:25:07,00 --> 00:25:11,50
He wraps his legs around her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS173
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:13,50
Now at the Hotel Rosslyn, 

BURLESQUE_DVS174
00:25:10,00 --> 00:25:20,50
SOMEONE finds her door broken in. She enters her ransacked studio apartment, then drops her purse and hurries into the bathroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS175
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:22,50
She finds the empty sandwich baggie on the floor. 

BURLESQUE_DVS176
00:25:23,00 --> 00:25:31,50
On the bed, SOMEONE finds her photograph under broken glass, halfway out of its now-bent frame. 

BURLESQUE_DVS177
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:33,50
She holds the photo of the mother and child. 

BURLESQUE_DVS178
00:25:30,00 --> 00:25:37,50
SOMEONE glances around, then sits on the edge of the bed and covers her mouth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS179
00:25:37,00 --> 00:25:43,50
Now SOMEONE rides down a street on a motorcycle and parks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS180
00:25:44,00 --> 00:25:50,50
She sits on the stoop of a picturesque Spanish-style apartment building. 

BURLESQUE_DVS181
00:25:47,00 --> 00:25:52,50
Later he lets her in. 

BURLESQUE_DVS182
00:26:38,00 --> 00:26:44,50
He takes back his phone and they sip their drinks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS183
00:26:55,00 --> 00:26:58,50
Later, SOMEONE 

BURLESQUE_DVS184
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:00,50
reclines on a daybed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS185
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:01,50
SOMEONE sits at a synthesizer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS186
00:27:59,00 --> 00:28:04,50
She nestles in and pulls her blanket close. 

BURLESQUE_DVS188
00:28:02,00 --> 00:28:07,50
Rain pounds the street outside. 

BURLESQUE_DVS189
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:08,50
SOMEONE wakes, 

BURLESQUE_DVS190
00:28:05,00 --> 00:28:12,50
then opens his bedroom's French doors and steps out in jeans and a white tank. 

BURLESQUE_DVS191
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:19,50
SOMEONE ogles SOMEONE's short pajama top. 

BURLESQUE_DVS192
00:28:54,00 --> 00:28:59,50
As she hops into some jeans, she tips over. 

BURLESQUE_DVS193
00:29:08,00 --> 00:29:12,50
She collects her suitcase and bag. 

BURLESQUE_DVS194
00:29:16,00 --> 00:29:23,50
SOMEONE steps out of the apartment building and peers morosely at the rain-pelted street. 

BURLESQUE_DVS195
00:29:24,00 --> 00:29:29,50
She grabs a newspaper and holds it overhead. 

BURLESQUE_DVS196
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:37,50
SOMEONE peers out of his window and watches her walk out to the curb. 

BURLESQUE_DVS197
00:29:36,00 --> 00:29:43,50
SOMEONE watches a car pass by. Then SOMEONE leaves the window. 

BURLESQUE_DVS198
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:45,50
As SOMEONE waits in the downpour at a bus stop, 

BURLESQUE_DVS199
00:29:42,00 --> 00:29:47,50
SOMEONE steps out, barefoot. 

BURLESQUE_DVS200
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:06,50
He picks her up. 

BURLESQUE_DVS201
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:08,50
Now inside. 

BURLESQUE_DVS202
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:22,50
He pushes the door shut. 

BURLESQUE_DVS203
00:30:22,00 --> 00:30:29,50
Now at the club, an employee polishes mirrored panels behind the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS204
00:30:26,00 --> 00:30:31,50
The cashier puts down chairs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS205
00:30:28,00 --> 00:30:34,50
As the band practices, a bartender wipes down a bottle. 

BURLESQUE_DVS206
00:30:31,00 --> 00:30:36,50
SOMEONE enters a bathroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS207
00:30:36,00 --> 00:30:41,50
She notes someone in a stall. 

BURLESQUE_DVS208
00:30:41,00 --> 00:30:46,50
The red-haired dancer steps out. 

BURLESQUE_DVS209
00:30:48,00 --> 00:30:52,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS210
00:30:54,00 --> 00:30:58,50
The young woman leans on the sink. 

BURLESQUE_DVS211
00:31:24,00 --> 00:31:28,50
They hug. 

BURLESQUE_DVS212
00:31:39,00 --> 00:31:44,50
SOMEONE peers nervously skyward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS213
00:31:41,00 --> 00:31:47,50
Now beaming dancers in plain clothes leap through the air. 

BURLESQUE_DVS214
00:31:44,00 --> 00:31:50,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from a table on the empty floor. 

BURLESQUE_DVS215
00:31:47,00 --> 00:31:53,50
SOMEONE enters the club and observes the girls onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS216
00:31:50,00 --> 00:31:56,50
As she doffs her jean jacket, she keeps watching. 

BURLESQUE_DVS217
00:31:59,00 --> 00:32:05,50
As the dancers leave, SOMEONE strides purposefully ahead. 

BURLESQUE_DVS218
00:32:18,00 --> 00:32:25,50
They notice SOMEONE onstage, swinging her hips and running her fingers down her blonde hair. 

BURLESQUE_DVS219
00:32:28,00 --> 00:32:33,50
SOMEONE peers back to the deejay booth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS220
00:32:44,00 --> 00:32:48,50
SOMEONE walks away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS221
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:52,50
She wheels around. 

BURLESQUE_DVS222
00:33:20,00 --> 00:33:29,50
SOMEONE shoots a satisfied glance toward SOMEONE at the back of the house. SOMEONE returns to the table, where SOMEONE raises an eyebrow. 

BURLESQUE_DVS223
00:33:26,00 --> 00:33:31,50
SOMEONE and Coco enter and spot SOMEONE onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS224
00:33:29,00 --> 00:33:35,50
Standing at a chair with her back turned, SOMEONE lets her hair down. 

BURLESQUE_DVS225
00:33:32,00 --> 00:33:36,50
SOMEONE joins the girls. 

BURLESQUE_DVS226
00:33:36,00 --> 00:33:41,50
Our view rises up SOMEONE's slender body 

BURLESQUE_DVS227
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:47,50
As SOMEONE enters with a box of liquor, he notices her too. 

BURLESQUE_DVS228
00:33:45,00 --> 00:33:51,50
SOMEONE gyrates her backside, then looks over her shoulder. 

BURLESQUE_DVS229
00:33:48,00 --> 00:33:54,50
Holding the back of the chair, she seductively points her knees in and out. 

BURLESQUE_DVS230
00:33:52,00 --> 00:33:57,50
She whips her hair back and steps forward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS231
00:33:55,00 --> 00:34:00,50
SOMEONE and the others keep watching. 

BURLESQUE_DVS232
00:33:57,00 --> 00:34:05,50
SOMEONE holds her hands out like paws, then slaps her backside with her right, then with her left, 

BURLESQUE_DVS233
00:34:02,00 --> 00:34:08,50
then twice more before resuming the wild dance. 

BURLESQUE_DVS234
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:11,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE, who eyes her knowingly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS235
00:34:08,00 --> 00:34:13,50
The club owner affords a slight nod. 

BURLESQUE_DVS236
00:34:10,00 --> 00:34:17,50
Now SOMEONE rubs her hands over her head and body, then points her knees in. 

BURLESQUE_DVS237
00:34:14,00 --> 00:34:28,50
SOMEONE softly shakes his head to himself. As SOMEONE leans forward and pouts her full lips, SOMEONE's cool gaze hardens even more. Onstage, SOMEONE prances, paws out, and grins adorably. 

BURLESQUE_DVS238
00:34:25,00 --> 00:34:30,50
SOMEONE remains watchful. 

BURLESQUE_DVS239
00:34:27,00 --> 00:34:36,50
A smiling SOMEONE points her knees and pops out her hands, then swings her arms, shakes her hips, and whips her hair back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS240
00:34:34,00 --> 00:34:40,50
SOMEONE smiles. SOMEONE glares. SOMEONE folds his hands. 

BURLESQUE_DVS241
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:12,50
SOMEONE beams. SOMEONE claps. 

BURLESQUE_DVS242
00:35:19,00 --> 00:35:23,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE leave. 

BURLESQUE_DVS243
00:35:21,00 --> 00:35:26,50
SOMEONE joins the excited young woman onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS244
00:35:33,00 --> 00:35:38,50
A delighted SOMEONE approaches, clapping. 

BURLESQUE_DVS245
00:35:50,00 --> 00:35:54,50
He nods. 

BURLESQUE_DVS246
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:55,50
SOMEONE gives a silent scream. 

BURLESQUE_DVS247
00:35:54,00 --> 00:36:00,50
As she runs off, SOMEONE wears a muted smile. Now at the costume rack. 

BURLESQUE_DVS249
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:14,50
A golden SOMEONE gun. 

BURLESQUE_DVS250
00:36:13,00 --> 00:36:18,50
It blasts him with gold confetti. 

BURLESQUE_DVS251
00:36:16,00 --> 00:36:21,50
He eyes her flatly and she forces a grin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS252
00:36:18,00 --> 00:36:24,50
Now SOMEONE struts confidently among pedestrians outside. 

BURLESQUE_DVS253
00:36:22,00 --> 00:36:27,50
At the club, she rehearses with the girls at the end of the line. 

BURLESQUE_DVS254
00:36:25,00 --> 00:36:30,50
Back with the pedestrians, she practices a move. 

BURLESQUE_DVS255
00:36:28,00 --> 00:36:37,50
In rehearsal, the dancers bounce, bop their heads, and gyrate their hips. On a sidewalk, SOMEONE practices the routine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS256
00:36:35,00 --> 00:36:42,50
The rehearsing dancers spin. Then SOMEONE spins on the street and resumes her walk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS257
00:36:39,00 --> 00:36:46,50
Onstage, a spotlight sweeps across the costumed girls. 

BURLESQUE_DVS258
00:36:43,00 --> 00:36:49,50
We cut from their routine to SOMEONE strolling down another street. 

BURLESQUE_DVS259
00:36:47,00 --> 00:36:52,50
She flourishes her wrist and gives a satisfied smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS260
00:36:50,00 --> 00:37:02,50
In a performance, the dancers frolic downstage, SOMEONE among them. The newest dancer runs her hands through her hair and shakes her hips. The view veers to SOMEONE backstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS261
00:36:59,00 --> 00:37:03,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE perform. 

BURLESQUE_DVS262
00:37:15,00 --> 00:37:19,50
The girls leave the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS263
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:37,50
Later in the dressing room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS264
00:37:40,00 --> 00:37:46,50
As SOMEONE pulls on her sweater, the other dancers head out of the dressing room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS265
00:37:43,00 --> 00:37:48,50
She slings her bag over her shoulder, 

BURLESQUE_DVS266
00:37:45,00 --> 00:37:52,50
then turns and sees the group disappearing down a staircase without her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS267
00:37:49,00 --> 00:37:53,50
With a heavy look, 

BURLESQUE_DVS268
00:37:50,00 --> 00:37:57,50
SOMEONE drops her bag back on the floor and plops into her chair at the dressing table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS269
00:37:54,00 --> 00:38:01,50
Resting her chin on her fist, she gazes at a black-and-white photo stuck to her mirror. 

BURLESQUE_DVS270
00:37:59,00 --> 00:38:03,50
It shows a glamorous burlesque dancer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS271
00:38:01,00 --> 00:38:06,50
SOMEONE's eyes shift to her makeup, 

BURLESQUE_DVS272
00:38:03,00 --> 00:38:07,50
then return to the photo. 

BURLESQUE_DVS273
00:38:04,00 --> 00:38:09,50
She picks up a thin makeup brush. 

BURLESQUE_DVS274
00:38:07,00 --> 00:38:11,50
As SOMEONE nears the dressing room, 

BURLESQUE_DVS275
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:15,50
she stops in the doorway and watches as SOMEONE tries to paint on eyeliner. 

BURLESQUE_DVS276
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:17,50
The blonde pushes her eyelashes up with a brush 

BURLESQUE_DVS277
00:38:15,00 --> 00:38:18,50
and flinches. 

BURLESQUE_DVS278
00:38:16,00 --> 00:38:20,50
SOMEONE moves beside her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS279
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:35,50
returns her gaze to the mirror and lifts the brush to her lashes again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS280
00:38:42,00 --> 00:38:47,50
SOMEONE unzips a pouch and withdraws a brush. 

BURLESQUE_DVS281
00:38:44,00 --> 00:38:48,50
She holds it out to SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS282
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:52,50
As SOMEONE starts up again, 

BURLESQUE_DVS283
00:38:50,00 --> 00:38:54,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS284
00:38:55,00 --> 00:38:58,50
She sits beside her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS285
00:39:11,00 --> 00:39:16,50
She paints black lines along SOMEONE's eyelid. 

BURLESQUE_DVS286
00:39:20,00 --> 00:39:25,50
She applies color to SOMEONE's lids. 

BURLESQUE_DVS287
00:39:53,00 --> 00:39:57,50
SOMEONE grins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS288
00:39:54,00 --> 00:40:00,50
SOMEONE uses a large soft brush to apply rouge to SOMEONE's cheeks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS289
00:40:00,00 --> 00:40:05,50
She playfully taps SOMEONE's nose with the bristles. 

BURLESQUE_DVS290
00:40:09,00 --> 00:40:15,50
Holding SOMEONE' gaze, SOMEONE gives a mild shrug. 

BURLESQUE_DVS291
00:40:13,00 --> 00:40:20,50
With a faint smile, SOMEONE uses another brush to paint lipstick onto SOMEONE's parted lips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS292
00:40:21,00 --> 00:40:26,50
SOMEONE averts her eyes. As she stares off, 

BURLESQUE_DVS293
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:29,50
SOMEONE skillfully finishes painting her lips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS295
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:32,50
she gently tilts SOMEONE's face and examines her handiwork. 

BURLESQUE_DVS296
00:40:30,00 --> 00:40:36,50
SOMEONE turns to the mirror and sees her red lips and painted eyelids. 

BURLESQUE_DVS297
00:40:36,00 --> 00:40:42,50
Tilting her head back and forth, she touches her face. 

BURLESQUE_DVS298
00:40:43,00 --> 00:40:50,50
Now SOMEONE reaches out of the shower and finds bras and stockings hanging on a hook. 

BURLESQUE_DVS299
00:40:47,00 --> 00:40:53,50
He turns to a towel rack where more undergarments hang. 

BURLESQUE_DVS300
00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:56,50
He spots his towel on the floor. 

BURLESQUE_DVS301
00:40:54,00 --> 00:40:58,50
SOMEONE sleeps in the living room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS302
00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:06,50
He picks up a newspaper. 

BURLESQUE_DVS303
00:41:15,00 --> 00:41:20,50
SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE grabs his phone off the bed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS304
00:41:19,00 --> 00:41:23,50
He swings the bedroom door shut. 

BURLESQUE_DVS305
00:41:22,00 --> 00:41:28,50
Later SOMEONE reads a housing ad in the newspaper. 

BURLESQUE_DVS306
00:41:25,00 --> 00:41:29,50
SOMEONE comes out. 

BURLESQUE_DVS307
00:41:31,00 --> 00:41:35,50
SOMEONE bites her thumb. 

BURLESQUE_DVS308
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:39,50
pulls on his shirt. 

BURLESQUE_DVS309
00:41:45,00 --> 00:41:49,50
He takes the newspaper from her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS310
00:43:02,00 --> 00:43:06,50
She snatches the paper back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS311
00:43:27,00 --> 00:43:32,50
She backs into his bedroom and closes the doors. 

BURLESQUE_DVS313
00:43:33,00 --> 00:43:41,50
At the lounge, a bartender carries crates of glasses and the band rehearses. SOMEONE storms out of SOMEONE' office. 

BURLESQUE_DVS314
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:50,50
SOMEONE pauses from organizing costumes on a rack and watches SOMEONE stalk away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS315
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:54,50
In her office, SOMEONE folds a piece of paper into an airplane. 

BURLESQUE_DVS316
00:43:51,00 --> 00:43:56,50
As she smooths the final crease, creating its wings, 

BURLESQUE_DVS317
00:43:54,00 --> 00:43:57,50
SOMEONE enters. 

BURLESQUE_DVS318
00:43:57,00 --> 00:44:02,50
SOMEONE tosses her paper plane at him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS319
00:43:59,00 --> 00:44:06,50
The backstage manager's gaze follows it as it lands on the floor at his feet. 

BURLESQUE_DVS320
00:44:03,00 --> 00:44:07,50
He picks it up and unfolds it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS321
00:44:21,00 --> 00:44:25,50
SOMEONE crumples the paper. 

BURLESQUE_DVS322
00:44:31,00 --> 00:44:35,50
Averting his gaze, SOMEONE shakes his head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS323
00:44:38,00 --> 00:44:42,50
SOMEONE lifts his chin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS324
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:44,50
He bows his head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS325
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:51,50
He locks his eyes with SOMEONE' desperate gaze, then moves forward to the couch where she sits. 

BURLESQUE_DVS326
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:55,50
He sits beside her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS327
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:01,50
He wraps his arms around her and she rests her head on his shoulder. 

BURLESQUE_DVS328
00:45:00,00 --> 00:45:04,50
He pats her arm. 

BURLESQUE_DVS329
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:08,50
Later in the crowded lounge, SOMEONE plays piano with the band. 

BURLESQUE_DVS330
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:13,50
As the dancers get ready backstage, SOMEONE descends the staircase with a drink in her hand. 

BURLESQUE_DVS331
00:45:10,00 --> 00:45:16,50
Wearing a skimpy biker-themed costume, she heads toward the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS332
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:27,50
SOMEONE sniffs the drink. 

BURLESQUE_DVS333
00:45:47,00 --> 00:45:51,50
SOMEONE pushes SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS334
00:45:51,00 --> 00:45:56,50
SOMEONE throws up her hands. 

BURLESQUE_DVS335
00:45:54,00 --> 00:46:01,50
SOMEONE tosses SOMEONE a costume. Meanwhile, SOMEONE enters the sound booth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS336
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:20,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE leave, then moves to his soundboard. Onstage, a spotlight shines on Coco. 

BURLESQUE_DVS337
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:30,50
The light shines on another dancer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS338
00:46:31,00 --> 00:46:38,50
As the red spotlight fixes on SOMEONE for her turn to lip-sync, SOMEONE pulls a plug. 

BURLESQUE_DVS339
00:46:38,00 --> 00:46:45,50
SOMEONE stops dancing and gazes across the lounge toward the sound booth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS340
00:46:42,00 --> 00:46:49,50
SOMEONE gives a satisfied smile. Meanwhile, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE backstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS341
00:46:56,00 --> 00:47:03,50
Onstage, SOMEONE sees the curtain descending. The doorman eyes departing patrons. 

BURLESQUE_DVS342
00:47:03,00 --> 00:47:08,50
SOMEONE tentatively steps to the front of the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS343
00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:11,50
As the curtain continues to drop, she opens her mouth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS344
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:16,50
SOMEONE, the doorman, and SOMEONE stare. 

BURLESQUE_DVS345
00:47:14,00 --> 00:47:19,50
The curtain freezes above SOMEONE's head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS346
00:47:26,00 --> 00:47:32,50
SOMEONE moves closer. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare, awestruck. 

BURLESQUE_DVS347
00:47:32,00 --> 00:47:38,50
The stagehand pulls a rope and the curtain rises back to the ceiling. 

BURLESQUE_DVS348
00:47:43,00 --> 00:47:50,50
A stagehand swivels a spotlight onto SOMEONE. As the band joins her, she struts toward the audience. 

BURLESQUE_DVS349
00:47:53,00 --> 00:48:00,50
Dancing, she swings her hips from side to side. SOMEONE smiles and shakes her head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS350
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:16,50
Audience members bop their heads and shimmy their shoulders. SOMEONE grins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS351
00:48:13,00 --> 00:48:17,50
SOMEONE tips her biker cap. 

BURLESQUE_DVS352
00:48:34,00 --> 00:48:47,50
The crowd claps and the two dancers behind SOMEONE sing backup as they step from side to side. SOMEONE glares down at them. SOMEONE beckons the backup dancers and they join her downstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS353
00:48:58,00 --> 00:49:04,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE exchange a disbelieving look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS354
00:49:01,00 --> 00:49:07,50
SOMEONE grabs a musician out of the band and pulls him onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS355
00:49:04,00 --> 00:49:09,50
Dancing around her, he plays the tambourine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS356
00:49:19,00 --> 00:49:26,50
SOMEONE strikes a pose with her arms in the air and the stage lights blink off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS357
00:49:23,00 --> 00:49:29,50
As Coco hugs SOMEONE, the crowd rises in a standing ovation. 

BURLESQUE_DVS358
00:49:27,00 --> 00:49:33,50
SOMEONE storms out of the sound booth with a sour expression. 

BURLESQUE_DVS359
00:49:30,00 --> 00:49:37,50
A spotlight fades up onstage and the bartenders, including SOMEONE, clap for the performers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS360
00:49:35,00 --> 00:49:40,50
SOMEONE's backup dancers push her forward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS361
00:49:37,00 --> 00:49:42,50
She curtsies, then bows with the others. 

BURLESQUE_DVS362
00:49:39,00 --> 00:49:43,50
The curtain falls. 

BURLESQUE_DVS363
00:49:45,00 --> 00:49:51,50
Backstage, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the other dancers crowd around. 

BURLESQUE_DVS364
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:06,50
SOMEONE looks on. 

BURLESQUE_DVS365
00:50:24,00 --> 00:50:31,50
SOMEONE's jaw drops. SOMEONE gives her dancers a thumbs up, then turns to SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS366
00:50:32,00 --> 00:50:36,50
SOMEONE glares at her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS367
00:50:38,00 --> 00:50:44,50
With a smile, SOMEONE strides away. SOMEONE juts out her chin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS368
00:50:42,00 --> 00:50:47,50
As the dancers disperse, SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS369
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:17,50
He heads away, passing SOMEONE, who stares at SOMEONE, her arms crossed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS370
00:51:14,00 --> 00:51:18,50
She smiles. 

BURLESQUE_DVS371
00:51:19,00 --> 00:51:24,50
She turns away with a conniving smirk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS372
00:51:21,00 --> 00:51:28,50
Now SOMEONE exits the backstage area and finds SOMEONE waiting for her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS373
00:51:25,00 --> 00:51:29,50
Grinning, he claps. 

BURLESQUE_DVS374
00:51:42,00 --> 00:51:47,50
SOMEONE nods as she walks off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS375
00:51:45,00 --> 00:51:52,50
After hours, SOMEONE and the other dancers hang out at the bar with SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS376
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:09,50
SOMEONE gets up. Coco looks at SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS377
00:52:10,00 --> 00:52:16,50
SOMEONE shifts her gaze from Coco to another dancer, who nods. 

BURLESQUE_DVS378
00:52:16,00 --> 00:52:21,50
SOMEONE stares after her as she leaves with them. 

BURLESQUE_DVS379
00:52:38,00 --> 00:52:42,50
He pretends to think. 

BURLESQUE_DVS380
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:04,50
As SOMEONE grabs her stuff, SOMEONE self-consciously looks away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS381
00:53:07,00 --> 00:53:12,50
With a smile, SOMEONE cocks his head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS382
00:53:11,00 --> 00:53:15,50
SOMEONE moves to his side. 

BURLESQUE_DVS383
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:17,50
He points to a mirror. 

BURLESQUE_DVS384
00:53:20,00 --> 00:53:24,50
He sweeps her hair up. 

BURLESQUE_DVS385
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:37,50
She gives the bald man a playful nudge. Now a light rises on SOMEONE in a platinum bobbed wig. 

BURLESQUE_DVS386
00:53:43,00 --> 00:53:47,50
She rises from the chaise lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS387
00:53:56,00 --> 00:54:00,50
SOMEONE watches dreamily. 

BURLESQUE_DVS388
00:54:01,00 --> 00:54:05,50
She tugs on a gold rope. 

BURLESQUE_DVS389
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:12,50
As the curtain rises, SOMEONE resumes his work. 

BURLESQUE_DVS390
00:54:10,00 --> 00:54:20,50
SOMEONE makes her way up some stairs, toward a platform. She tosses her head and shoulders back with each beat, then wiggles her hips at the crowd. 

BURLESQUE_DVS391
00:54:17,00 --> 00:54:24,50
Bending forward, she shakes her rear and the feathers on her short skirt flutter. 

BURLESQUE_DVS392
00:54:22,00 --> 00:54:27,50
She sits on a step and kicks her feet in the air. 

BURLESQUE_DVS393
00:54:24,00 --> 00:54:36,50
Facing the audience, she quickly spreads her knees, then crosses her legs. She dances up the rest of the stairs to the platform where another curtain opens, revealing more dancers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS394
00:55:10,00 --> 00:55:14,50
Now SOMEONE dances on the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS395
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:25,50
As a glass slides toward her, she kicks it out of the way. She struts to the wall of mirrored panels behind the bar and strikes a pose. As she pushes on one panel, it spins and she disappears behind it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS396
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:30,50
A different panel spins and SOMEONE rotates into the room, then whirls away again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS397
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:33,50
All of the panels turn with dancers in front of each. 

BURLESQUE_DVS398
00:55:30,00 --> 00:55:35,50
A bartender leans forward, 

BURLESQUE_DVS399
00:55:32,00 --> 00:55:37,50
bridging the wall and the bar with his back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS400
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:39,50
Two others lead SOMEONE across. 

BURLESQUE_DVS401
00:55:44,00 --> 00:55:51,50
She swoons backwards off the bar. Two bartenders catch her and carry her to the chaise lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS402
00:55:51,00 --> 00:55:56,50
She pretends to take a shot. 

BURLESQUE_DVS403
00:55:56,00 --> 00:56:00,50
The stage lights turn off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS404
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:06,50
Later as SOMEONE works behind the bar, SOMEONE appears, still in her short sequined dress and platinum blonde wig. 

BURLESQUE_DVS405
00:56:06,00 --> 00:56:10,50
SOMEONE gives her a sidelong look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS406
00:56:09,00 --> 00:56:13,50
She spins on her stool. 

BURLESQUE_DVS407
00:56:21,00 --> 00:56:27,50
Her smile fades and she walks away. SOMEONE stares after her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS409
00:56:33,00 --> 00:56:37,50
SOMEONE struggles to uncap a spray bottle. 

BURLESQUE_DVS410
00:56:37,00 --> 00:56:43,50
SOMEONE easily removes the cap, then leans closer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS411
00:56:42,00 --> 00:56:47,50
SOMEONE gapes as SOMEONE strides away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS412
00:56:44,00 --> 00:56:48,50
In the lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS413
00:56:48,00 --> 00:56:54,50
SOMEONE sets drinks on Marcus' table and sits across from him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS415
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:43,50
at SOMEONE's place. 

BURLESQUE_DVS416
00:57:41,00 --> 00:57:49,50
Coming home, SOMEONE spies SOMEONE in the bedroom, wearing only pink panties and a matching bra. 

BURLESQUE_DVS417
00:57:46,00 --> 00:57:51,50
He steps further into the apartment, 

BURLESQUE_DVS418
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:53,50
his mesmerized gaze fixed on her curves. 

BURLESQUE_DVS419
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:56,50
His bag topples candles on the coffee table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS420
00:57:56,00 --> 00:58:00,50
He returns to the door. 

BURLESQUE_DVS421
00:58:04,00 --> 00:58:09,50
SOMEONE joins her at a mirror and zips up her dress. 

BURLESQUE_DVS422
00:58:15,00 --> 00:58:20,50
He notices SOMEONE's photo. 

BURLESQUE_DVS424
00:58:33,00 --> 00:58:38,50
SOMEONE glances up at him with a winsome pout. 

BURLESQUE_DVS425
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:44,50
SOMEONE smiles warmly as she holds his gaze. 

BURLESQUE_DVS426
00:58:50,00 --> 00:58:55,50
Grinning boyishly, he steps away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS427
00:58:52,00 --> 00:58:56,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. 

BURLESQUE_DVS428
00:58:56,00 --> 00:59:04,50
Now feather fans lift away to reveal SOMEONE reclined on the lounge piano, in a skimpy two-piece outfit made of pearls. 

BURLESQUE_DVS429
00:59:18,00 --> 00:59:25,50
She pushes the pianist's head past her lap, then shimmies her pearls. 

BURLESQUE_DVS430
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:28,50
At home, SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a comfortable laugh in the living room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS431
00:59:25,00 --> 00:59:32,50
At the lounge, SOMEONE pops a champagne bottle's cork and smirks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS432
00:59:48,00 --> 00:59:54,50
At a table, SOMEONE thoughtfully rubs his chin as he watches her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS433
00:59:58,00 --> 01:00:05,50
Now as she rides with SOMEONE on his motorcycle, her sheer scarf flies away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS434
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:17,50
As SOMEONE puts her back to the audience, her top flies off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS435
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:23,50
A dancer hands her a fan and she covers her chest. Turning away, she lowers the fan and shimmies. 

BURLESQUE_DVS436
01:00:20,00 --> 01:00:25,50
Quickly covering herself, she faces the crowd again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS437
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:35,50
Her pearl briefs fly off. She snatches another fan from a dancer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS438
01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:39,50
Now SOMEONE hurries into the dressing room with a giddy smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS439
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:44,50
She shows an engagement ring. The girls rush to hug her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS440
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:46,50
Back onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS441
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:56,50
Peeking out from behind a fan, she comically blows feathers and hair out of her face. 

BURLESQUE_DVS442
01:00:53,00 --> 01:01:02,50
Now SOMEONE blows out birthday candles. Standing apart, SOMEONE snaps a photo, then smiles and winks at her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS443
01:00:59,00 --> 01:01:04,50
SOMEONE gazes tenderly at him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS444
01:01:01,00 --> 01:01:06,50
Onstage, she shimmies her fans. 

BURLESQUE_DVS445
01:01:04,00 --> 01:01:10,50
As she flings them away, her backup dancers raise two more in their place. 

BURLESQUE_DVS446
01:01:08,00 --> 01:01:13,50
They part the fans, revealing her naked form. 

BURLESQUE_DVS447
01:01:10,00 --> 01:01:17,50
A pair of bongos cover her breasts and a candle conceals her crotch. 

BURLESQUE_DVS448
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:20,50
SOMEONE winks. Later she meets SOMEONE at the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS449
01:01:21,00 --> 01:01:25,50
He stares, slack-jawed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS450
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:37,50
SOMEONE carries a crate of glasses away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS451
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:42,50
SOMEONE arrives at SOMEONE's side. 

BURLESQUE_DVS452
01:01:51,00 --> 01:01:54,50
He grabs her bag. 

BURLESQUE_DVS453
01:02:01,00 --> 01:02:08,50
Later SOMEONE rides in a vintage convertible speedster as SOMEONE drives. 

BURLESQUE_DVS454
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:42,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS455
01:02:39,00 --> 01:02:44,50
The speedster makes a turn. 

BURLESQUE_DVS456
01:02:41,00 --> 01:02:47,50
Later it pulls up outside a glamorous party. 

BURLESQUE_DVS457
01:02:44,00 --> 01:02:49,50
Primping, SOMEONE takes her hair down. 

BURLESQUE_DVS458
01:02:46,00 --> 01:02:53,50
As she and SOMEONE enter, several trendy upscale guests take notice. 

BURLESQUE_DVS459
01:02:52,00 --> 01:03:00,50
He takes her into a kitchen staffed with caterers and grabs one of the many bottles of wine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS460
01:03:01,00 --> 01:03:06,50
He takes two glasses and a tray of hors d'oeuvres. 

BURLESQUE_DVS461
01:03:08,00 --> 01:03:13,50
Leading her downstairs, he meets two guests., 

BURLESQUE_DVS462
01:03:21,00 --> 01:03:25,50
SOMEONE leads SOMEONE onward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS463
01:03:33,00 --> 01:03:37,50
She halts in a doorway. 

BURLESQUE_DVS464
01:03:36,00 --> 01:03:40,50
A city view. 

BURLESQUE_DVS465
01:04:12,00 --> 01:04:17,50
SOMEONE gives her a smirk and sips his wine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS466
01:04:34,00 --> 01:04:40,50
Turning away, SOMEONE sips her wine with a cynical smirk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS467
01:04:37,00 --> 01:04:43,50
Now SOMEONE lies on the daybed with his eyes closed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS468
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:46,50
His eyes open as SOMEONE arrives home. 

BURLESQUE_DVS469
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:49,50
Now a gift box sits on a dressing-room stool. 

BURLESQUE_DVS470
01:04:53,00 --> 01:04:59,50
SOMEONE reads the card: To the best view in LA - SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS471
01:04:57,00 --> 01:05:05,50
As the other girls look on, she opens the present and pulls out a pair of Louboutin shoes just like SOMEONE's. 

BURLESQUE_DVS472
01:05:09,00 --> 01:05:14,50
SOMEONE marches over and grabs the card. 

BURLESQUE_DVS473
01:05:15,00 --> 01:05:20,50
As she reads it, her smirk fades. 

BURLESQUE_DVS474
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:34,50
SOMEONE leaves. 

BURLESQUE_DVS475
01:05:40,00 --> 01:05:45,50
Facing her mirror, SOMEONE dons a bowler hat. 

BURLESQUE_DVS476
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:11,50
Now with the stage set to resemble the dressing room, SOMEONE and the dancers mime preparations for a show. 

BURLESQUE_DVS477
01:06:09,00 --> 01:06:17,50
The fake mirrors whisk upstage and three more dancers crawl out of them to simple wooden chairs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS478
01:06:14,00 --> 01:06:21,50
SOMEONE and the first two dancers pose erotically in their own chairs and snap their fingers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS479
01:06:18,00 --> 01:06:23,50
A dance begins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS481
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:02,50
SOMEONE watches from his corner table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS482
01:06:59,00 --> 01:07:07,50
At home, SOMEONE adds notations to sheet music, then stares thoughtfully at it. SOMEONE arrives. 

BURLESQUE_DVS483
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:13,50
As she removes her coat, he shakes his head and smiles. 

BURLESQUE_DVS484
01:07:21,00 --> 01:07:26,50
He notices her Louboutins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS485
01:07:28,00 --> 01:07:33,50
He watches from his keyboard as she walks into the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS487
01:07:43,00 --> 01:07:48,50
her costume bears two handprints on her buttocks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS488
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:09,50
SOMEONE works her hands up her body to her hair. Her backup dancers move upside-down on their chairs in acrobatic positions. At home, SOMEONE struts in her sparkly four-inch Louboutins as she puts on the new outfit. 

BURLESQUE_DVS489
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:33,50
She leaves. Onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS492
01:08:41,00 --> 01:08:46,50
At the entrance, a long line appears. 

BURLESQUE_DVS493
01:08:46,00 --> 01:08:51,50
Back inside the packed lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS494
01:08:57,00 --> 01:09:02,50
Looking on, SOMEONE smiles proudly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS495
01:09:05,00 --> 01:09:13,50
SOMEONE lifts her knee in a sexy pose with one of her backup dancers. SOMEONE seethes as she watches. 

BURLESQUE_DVS496
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:19,50
Mesmerized by the performance, SOMEONE interlaces his fingers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS497
01:09:17,00 --> 01:09:22,50
Now he drives SOMEONE in his vintage convertible. 

BURLESQUE_DVS498
01:09:19,00 --> 01:09:26,50
At his home, they share an intimate laugh as they sit on the couch by candlelight. 

BURLESQUE_DVS499
01:09:24,00 --> 01:09:31,50
Back in the lounge, the dancers advance downstage, reaching their hands toward the audience. 

BURLESQUE_DVS500
01:09:28,00 --> 01:09:36,50
SOMEONE turns in profile and bumps her shoulders forward into an animalistic slouch. 

BURLESQUE_DVS501
01:09:33,00 --> 01:09:39,50
Spreading their legs, the dancers bend over and whip their hair. 

BURLESQUE_DVS502
01:09:46,00 --> 01:09:55,50
At home, SOMEONE finds a note taped to a mirror written on sheet music paper: Going out. See you tomorrow - SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS503
01:09:52,00 --> 01:09:56,50
Back onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS504
01:10:00,00 --> 01:10:07,50
SOMEONE and the others dance with precision and raw sensuality as the stage lights strobe. 

BURLESQUE_DVS505
01:10:06,00 --> 01:10:14,50
Now a makeup mirror reflects a newspaper photo of SOMEONE performing in the burlesque lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS506
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:19,50
SOMEONE smiles in her office as she reads the article on the front page of the LA Times Calendar section. 

BURLESQUE_DVS507
01:10:17,00 --> 01:10:22,50
The photo shows SOMEONE with Coco and another dancer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS508
01:10:20,00 --> 01:10:30,50
SOMEONE sets down the paper and picks up a bank letter headed, Notice of Defaulted Payment. A red stamp reads, Final Notice. 

BURLESQUE_DVS509
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:33,50
SOMEONE crumples it up. 

BURLESQUE_DVS510
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:37,50
In the dressing room, the girls huddle around the newspaper feature. 

BURLESQUE_DVS511
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:43,50
Coco faces SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS512
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:58,50
Meanwhile, two contortionists lie with their chins to the stage. Posed in deep backbends, they flick their toes over their heads. The doorman crouches between them. 

BURLESQUE_DVS513
01:10:57,00 --> 01:11:01,50
They scissor kick. 

BURLESQUE_DVS514
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:07,50
One does a handstand and wraps her thighs around the doorman. The other sticks her leg straight up along his back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS515
01:11:06,00 --> 01:11:10,50
At Marcus' table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS516
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:13,50
SOMEONE arrives. 

BURLESQUE_DVS517
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:33,50
The doorman falls face-first into a contortionist's crotch. 

BURLESQUE_DVS518
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:36,50
A patron spits out his drink with laughter. 

BURLESQUE_DVS519
01:11:37,00 --> 01:11:43,50
From the bar, SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch SOMEONE with the two men. 

BURLESQUE_DVS520
01:11:43,00 --> 01:11:54,50
One of the contortionists passes the doorman a banana between her legs. He peels it, then gets distracted by her breasts, and lowers the phallic fruit to his crotch. 

BURLESQUE_DVS521
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:57,50
The other contortionist deep-throats it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS522
01:11:54,00 --> 01:12:01,50
From a table overlooking the crowd, SOMEONE notices SOMEONE with SOMEONE and Harold. 

BURLESQUE_DVS523
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:02,50
SOMEONE arrives at her side. 

BURLESQUE_DVS524
01:12:17,00 --> 01:12:26,50
One contortionist spreads her legs overhead and the doorman strikes a triangle between her thighs. Now in the dressing room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS525
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:23,50
She picks up her clutch purse. 

BURLESQUE_DVS526
01:13:22,00 --> 01:13:27,50
SOMEONE gives an affectionate smile as SOMEONE walks away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS527
01:13:26,00 --> 01:13:31,50
She bites her lip worriedly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS528
01:13:30,00 --> 01:13:34,50
SOMEONE brings costumes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS529
01:13:37,00 --> 01:13:42,50
SOMEONE glances after SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS530
01:13:40,00 --> 01:13:44,50
He kisses SOMEONE' cheek. 

BURLESQUE_DVS531
01:13:43,00 --> 01:13:48,50
She watches him go with a grateful smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS532
01:13:45,00 --> 01:13:52,50
Now she enters the stage area, her arms loaded with costumes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS533
01:13:49,00 --> 01:13:54,50
SOMEONE calls out from the deejay booth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS534
01:14:11,00 --> 01:14:16,50
She drops the costumes, then removes her 

BURLESQUE_DVS535
01:14:13,00 --> 01:14:20,50
coat, revealing a black sparkling top with a matching cardigan and pants. 

BURLESQUE_DVS536
01:14:21,00 --> 01:14:26,50
She climbs wearily onto the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS537
01:14:23,00 --> 01:14:30,50
SOMEONE puts on a CD labeled, Instrumental Only, Last of Me. 

BURLESQUE_DVS538
01:14:27,00 --> 01:14:31,50
He cuts the stage lights. 

BURLESQUE_DVS539
01:14:28,00 --> 01:14:34,50
SOMEONE places a chair center stage and straddles it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS540
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:37,50
SOMEONE focuses a blue-tinted spotlight on her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS541
01:17:55,00 --> 01:18:01,50
Silhouetted by an offstage light, she strolls away stoically. 

BURLESQUE_DVS542
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:06,50
SOMEONE gazes after her with a small admiring nod, then switches off the spotlight. 

BURLESQUE_DVS543
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:07,50
SOMEONE steps outside with 

BURLESQUE_DVS544
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:10,50
costumes and heads down the entrance stairs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS545
01:18:07,00 --> 01:18:11,50
SOMEONE waits for her at the bottom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS546
01:18:09,00 --> 01:18:14,50
Wearing fingerless leather gloves, she takes a drag off a cigarette. 

BURLESQUE_DVS548
01:19:23,00 --> 01:19:29,50
SOMEONE gets in a convertible and wrestles her bag down beside her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS549
01:19:34,00 --> 01:19:43,50
SOMEONE gives an incredulous stare. As SOMEONE backs out of her spot, her old mentor tosses her keys down onto her car's trunk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS550
01:19:41,00 --> 01:19:49,50
SOMEONE takes out a crowbar and smashes SOMEONE's passenger window as she drives past. The car stops abruptly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS551
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:58,50
With an indignant gape, she peels off. SOMEONE flings the crowbar back into her trunk then turns and leans on the bumper. 

BURLESQUE_DVS552
01:19:58,00 --> 01:20:04,50
Now SOMEONE arrives home in a red clingy dress. 

BURLESQUE_DVS553
01:20:02,00 --> 01:20:09,50
Eyeing the daybed, she pauses briefly, then crosses to the French doors and opens them. 

BURLESQUE_DVS554
01:20:07,00 --> 01:20:11,50
She finds SOMEONE sleeping in the bed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS555
01:20:10,00 --> 01:20:15,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes resentfully and pulls the doors shut. 

BURLESQUE_DVS556
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:25,50
Now in their apartment, SOMEONE irritably grinds coffee. SOMEONE stirs awake in the red cocktail dress. 

BURLESQUE_DVS557
01:22:13,00 --> 01:22:19,50
He shuts the bedroom doors. She flings a pillow at a lamp. 

BURLESQUE_DVS558
01:22:22,00 --> 01:22:26,50
Now at a wedding. 

BURLESQUE_DVS559
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:32,50
SOMEONE kisses Damon. 

BURLESQUE_DVS560
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:35,50
Later at the reception, SOMEONE watches SOMEONE talk on his cell phone. 

BURLESQUE_DVS561
01:22:53,00 --> 01:23:00,50
With his eyes on SOMEONE, he lowers the phone. Now SOMEONE sits with Coco. 

BURLESQUE_DVS562
01:23:13,00 --> 01:23:19,50
As SOMEONE sips his drink, the deejay grins at him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS563
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:21,50
At a bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS564
01:23:31,00 --> 01:23:36,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE dance. 

BURLESQUE_DVS565
01:24:03,00 --> 01:24:08,50
He hugs her from behind. 

BURLESQUE_DVS566
01:24:09,00 --> 01:24:13,50
He kisses her cheek. 

BURLESQUE_DVS567
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:21,50
Now leaning on the bar, SOMEONE sips the last of a cocktail. SOMEONE approaches and leans on the bar beside him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS568
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:42,50
She ignores his toast. 

BURLESQUE_DVS569
01:24:42,00 --> 01:24:47,50
SOMEONE giggles, then downs her shot. 

BURLESQUE_DVS570
01:24:45,00 --> 01:24:51,50
SOMEONE nudges her with his elbow and leans in close. 

BURLESQUE_DVS571
01:25:02,00 --> 01:25:09,50
He points at the deejay, who points back. As SOMEONE leaves the bar, SOMEONE grabs her hand. 

BURLESQUE_DVS572
01:25:10,00 --> 01:25:15,50
They face each other on the dance floor. 

BURLESQUE_DVS573
01:25:41,00 --> 01:25:45,50
He grins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS574
01:25:44,00 --> 01:25:48,50
They dance. 

BURLESQUE_DVS575
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:51,50
He spins her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS577
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:58,50
As they enter the darkened apartment, SOMEONE knocks over a lamp. 

BURLESQUE_DVS578
01:26:10,00 --> 01:26:14,50
He bumps the lamp again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS579
01:26:16,00 --> 01:26:23,50
SOMEONE looks demurely up at him from the daybed. SOMEONE smiles genteelly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS580
01:26:25,00 --> 01:26:29,50
He hands SOMEONE her shoes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS581
01:26:29,00 --> 01:26:34,50
SOMEONE steps into the bedroom and shuts the doors. 

BURLESQUE_DVS582
01:26:32,00 --> 01:26:37,50
A disappointed SOMEONE glances after him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS583
01:26:34,00 --> 01:26:40,50
He reopens the doors, wearing bright red pajamas. 

BURLESQUE_DVS584
01:26:47,00 --> 01:26:52,50
He flourishes his arms. 

BURLESQUE_DVS585
01:26:59,00 --> 01:27:04,50
She watches him cross back to the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS586
01:27:06,00 --> 01:27:10,50
He shuts the doors. 

BURLESQUE_DVS587
01:27:09,00 --> 01:27:14,50
He reopens the doors, shirtless. 

BURLESQUE_DVS588
01:27:17,00 --> 01:27:23,50
As he enters the kitchen, she admires his toned back on the sly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS589
01:27:22,00 --> 01:27:28,50
As he returns to the bedroom, she checks him out again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS590
01:27:25,00 --> 01:27:31,50
SOMEONE spins around in the doorway and SOMEONE shakes her head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS591
01:27:35,00 --> 01:27:41,50
SOMEONE removes her earrings, her back to the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS592
01:27:38,00 --> 01:27:42,50
SOMEONE reemerges naked. 

BURLESQUE_DVS593
01:27:40,00 --> 01:27:45,50
A chair, then a lamp conveniently hide his groin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS594
01:27:49,00 --> 01:27:53,50
SOMEONE still has her back to him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS595
01:27:53,00 --> 01:27:57,50
SOMEONE sees his bare tush. 

BURLESQUE_DVS596
01:27:56,00 --> 01:28:00,50
She covers her eyes, but peeks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS597
01:28:01,00 --> 01:28:08,50
He innocently holds a box of Famous Amos cookies over his privates. 

BURLESQUE_DVS598
01:28:12,00 --> 01:28:16,50
He returns to the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS599
01:28:22,00 --> 01:28:26,50
He shuts the French doors. 

BURLESQUE_DVS600
01:28:28,00 --> 01:28:33,50
As SOMEONE looks over her shoulder, the bedroom lights go out. 

BURLESQUE_DVS601
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:40,50
She lowers her disappointed gaze and purses her lips, then gets up from the daybed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS602
01:28:40,00 --> 01:28:45,50
Reaching behind her back, she goes to unzip her dress. 

BURLESQUE_DVS604
01:28:45,00 --> 01:28:50,50
SOMEONE reopens the doors. 

BURLESQUE_DVS605
01:28:49,00 --> 01:28:57,50
With a smoldering gaze, he steps out of the bedroom and approaches SOMEONE, then gently brushes her long blonde hair off her shoulder. 

BURLESQUE_DVS606
01:28:58,00 --> 01:29:04,50
He kisses her smooth neck and they share a peck on the lips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS610
01:29:10,00 --> 01:29:15,50
Facing each other, SOMEONE runs his fingers through her hair. They kiss again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS611
01:29:12,00 --> 01:29:18,50
They gaze into each other's eyes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS614
01:29:54,00 --> 01:30:00,50
Daytime. In bed, SOMEONE rests her head on SOMEONE's chest. 

BURLESQUE_DVS615
01:30:09,00 --> 01:30:15,50
Pouring rain streaks their bedroom window. 

BURLESQUE_DVS616
01:30:12,00 --> 01:30:18,50
Onstage, SOMEONE sings in a satiny chartreuse gown. 

BURLESQUE_DVS617
01:30:53,00 --> 01:30:58,50
The image dissolves from SOMEONE onstage to the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS618
01:30:56,00 --> 01:31:02,50
SOMEONE lies in bed with a camera as SOMEONE pulls a black stocking over her knee. 

BURLESQUE_DVS619
01:31:05,00 --> 01:31:11,50
She pulls the stocking back down her leg, then bites her bottom lip. 

BURLESQUE_DVS620
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:12,50
SOMEONE beckons. 

BURLESQUE_DVS621
01:31:12,00 --> 01:31:17,50
Onstage, SOMEONE sings to a full house. 

BURLESQUE_DVS622
01:31:51,00 --> 01:31:55,50
They lounge in bed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS623
01:32:32,00 --> 01:32:36,50
They embrace. 

BURLESQUE_DVS624
01:32:33,00 --> 01:32:37,50
Back onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS625
01:33:35,00 --> 01:33:42,50
Silhouetted against a brilliant spotlight, SOMEONE closes her hands and gently lowers her arms. 

BURLESQUE_DVS626
01:33:44,00 --> 01:33:49,50
Now a young woman enters the apartment. 

BURLESQUE_DVS627
01:33:49,00 --> 01:33:58,50
She sets down a suitcase and tosses aside her keys. Scanning the living room, she finds an article of clothing. 

BURLESQUE_DVS628
01:33:56,00 --> 01:34:00,50
She barges into the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS629
01:34:38,00 --> 01:34:42,50
She shoves past him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS630
01:34:43,00 --> 01:34:48,50
Now SOMEONE's wedding deejay opens a front door. 

BURLESQUE_DVS631
01:35:09,00 --> 01:35:13,50
In SOMEONE's bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS632
01:35:14,00 --> 01:35:19,50
SOMEONE looks up from his bed and they smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS633
01:35:41,00 --> 01:35:46,50
Wearing only a blanket, SOMEONE covers up. 

BURLESQUE_DVS634
01:36:12,00 --> 01:36:17,50
In the kitchen, SOMEONE makes coffee. 

BURLESQUE_DVS635
01:36:33,00 --> 01:36:38,50
SOMEONE sighs and lowers a spoon. 

BURLESQUE_DVS636
01:36:37,00 --> 01:36:43,50
Now at Jacks apartment. SOMEONE leaves with her luggage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS637
01:36:40,00 --> 01:36:46,50
Later at SOMEONE's second floor apartment, SOMEONE steps outside. 

BURLESQUE_DVS638
01:36:59,00 --> 01:37:04,50
SOMEONE pulls into the driveway on his motorcycle. 

BURLESQUE_DVS639
01:37:05,00 --> 01:37:10,50
SOMEONE passes the deejay on his way upstairs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS640
01:37:24,00 --> 01:37:27,50
He heads off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS641
01:37:25,00 --> 01:37:30,50
SOMEONE looks pointedly after SOMEONE walking to his car. 

BURLESQUE_DVS642
01:37:29,00 --> 01:37:33,50
SOMEONE turns. 

BURLESQUE_DVS643
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:50,50
Now in SOMEONE' office. 

BURLESQUE_DVS645
01:39:32,00 --> 01:39:36,50
SOMEONE heads for the door. 

BURLESQUE_DVS646
01:39:41,00 --> 01:39:51,50
Now at Marcus' contemporary three-story mansion, SOMEONE walks up a staircase to the top floor and its breathtaking view of the city. 

BURLESQUE_DVS647
01:39:52,00 --> 01:39:59,50
She looks out a window and spots SOMEONE pacing outside on his phone. 

BURLESQUE_DVS648
01:39:57,00 --> 01:40:04,50
She leaves the window and regards an architectural model of a city block set up on a table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS649
01:40:04,00 --> 01:40:09,50
SOMEONE notes an address on the model: 

BURLESQUE_DVS650
01:40:06,00 --> 01:40:11,50
8080 Sunset Boulevard. 

BURLESQUE_DVS651
01:40:08,00 --> 01:40:13,50
SOMEONE joins her and hands her a coffee mug. 

BURLESQUE_DVS652
01:40:59,00 --> 01:41:03,50
She grabs her jacket. 

BURLESQUE_DVS653
01:41:10,00 --> 01:41:15,50
She walks out and leaves SOMEONE standing alone. 

BURLESQUE_DVS654
01:41:15,00 --> 01:41:21,50
Now we descend to the lit-up sign for the Burlesque Lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS655
01:41:18,00 --> 01:41:25,50
Inside SOMEONE crosses a dim hallway adorned with memorabilia. 

BURLESQUE_DVS656
01:41:22,00 --> 01:41:30,50
She stops and takes a second long look at a red neon sign which reads, The Best View on the Sunset Strip. 

BURLESQUE_DVS657
01:41:28,00 --> 01:41:32,50
SOMEONE hurries on. 

BURLESQUE_DVS658
01:41:29,00 --> 01:41:36,50
Onstage, dancers move in unison while the seated band performs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS659
01:41:33,00 --> 01:41:38,50
In the dressing room, SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS660
01:41:43,00 --> 01:41:47,50
She holds up a bottle of tequila. 

BURLESQUE_DVS661
01:42:22,00 --> 01:42:26,50
SOMEONE enters SOMEONE' office. 

BURLESQUE_DVS662
01:42:41,00 --> 01:42:47,50
SOMEONE lowers her gaze, then looks up and gives an amused roll of the eyes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS663
01:42:54,00 --> 01:43:00,50
Onstage, the dancers finish their number to the delight of a packed house. 

BURLESQUE_DVS664
01:43:01,00 --> 01:43:08,50
Now SOMEONE chats with SOMEONE as they exit the lounge, passing under its unlit archway. 

BURLESQUE_DVS665
01:43:05,00 --> 01:43:15,50
They head across the street to the high-rise of luxury condos. Inside, a white-haired man sits at a desk, talking on the phone. 

BURLESQUE_DVS666
01:43:12,00 --> 01:43:17,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter his office. 

BURLESQUE_DVS667
01:43:22,00 --> 01:43:26,50
As he hangs up, the women sit. 

BURLESQUE_DVS668
01:43:44,00 --> 01:43:48,50
He gives SOMEONE a brochure. 

BURLESQUE_DVS669
01:44:21,00 --> 01:44:27,50
The white-haired businessman gives a confused look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS671
01:44:25,00 --> 01:44:31,50
The lights on the lounge's archway glow onto the sidewalk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS672
01:44:28,00 --> 01:44:36,50
Inside the club, SOMEONE strolls up to SOMEONE, who sits at a table looking through a stack of paperwork. 

BURLESQUE_DVS673
01:44:33,00 --> 01:44:38,50
She takes a seat across from him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS674
01:44:57,00 --> 01:45:02,50
Smiling, she drops an envelope in front of him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS675
01:44:59,00 --> 01:45:06,50
He opens it and finds a check for $500,000. 

BURLESQUE_DVS676
01:45:04,00 --> 01:45:08,50
He stares at her with wide eyes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS677
01:45:10,00 --> 01:45:14,50
She glances skyward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS678
01:45:13,00 --> 01:45:17,50
He shakes his head at the check. 

BURLESQUE_DVS679
01:45:17,00 --> 01:45:22,50
He gives her a nod and she presses her lips to his. 

BURLESQUE_DVS680
01:45:21,00 --> 01:45:25,50
Pulling away, she eyes him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS681
01:45:25,00 --> 01:45:30,50
As she leaves, SOMEONE's lips curl into a smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS682
01:45:28,00 --> 01:45:33,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE chats with a bartender. 

BURLESQUE_DVS683
01:45:30,00 --> 01:45:35,50
SOMEONE strolls up to the bar and leans her back against it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS684
01:45:33,00 --> 01:45:38,50
SOMEONE swivels her stool to face the same direction. 

BURLESQUE_DVS685
01:45:49,00 --> 01:45:55,50
They share a grin and SOMEONE good-naturedly smacks SOMEONE's leg. 

BURLESQUE_DVS686
01:45:53,00 --> 01:45:58,50
Entering the lounge, SOMEONE spots them. 

BURLESQUE_DVS687
01:45:55,00 --> 01:46:00,50
The women's smiles fade as they notice her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS688
01:45:57,00 --> 01:46:03,50
As she approaches SOMEONE, SOMEONE turns back to the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS689
01:46:00,00 --> 01:46:06,50
SOMEONE hangs her head, then lifts her tearful gaze. 

BURLESQUE_DVS690
01:46:17,00 --> 01:46:21,50
She gives SOMEONE an earnest look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS691
01:46:19,00 --> 01:46:24,50
The club owner replies with a gentle smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS692
01:46:23,00 --> 01:46:27,50
SOMEONE beams. 

BURLESQUE_DVS693
01:46:28,00 --> 01:46:33,50
With a nod, SOMEONE hurries off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS694
01:46:30,00 --> 01:46:34,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS695
01:46:40,00 --> 01:46:44,50
She puts her head on SOMEONE' shoulder. 

BURLESQUE_DVS696
01:46:48,00 --> 01:46:53,50
She hops off her stool and walks away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS697
01:46:50,00 --> 01:46:54,50
SOMEONE stares after her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS698
01:46:53,00 --> 01:47:00,50
With a serene look, she turns away and sips from a glass of dessert wine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS699
01:46:58,00 --> 01:47:04,50
SOMEONE approaches and leans beside her on the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS700
01:47:16,00 --> 01:47:23,50
He heads away, leaving SOMEONE at the bar with a faint smile on her lips and a faraway look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS701
01:47:22,00 --> 01:47:28,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE climbs the stairs to the dressing room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS702
01:47:25,00 --> 01:47:32,50
She sets down her bag, removes her jacket, and sits at her vanity table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS703
01:47:29,00 --> 01:47:36,50
Behind her, SOMEONE combs her hair, her eyes fixed on the blonde. 

BURLESQUE_DVS704
01:47:33,00 --> 01:47:40,50
SOMEONE lifts a brush to her eyes then spots her rival in the reflection of her mirror. 

BURLESQUE_DVS705
01:47:39,00 --> 01:47:43,50
She gives SOMEONE a cordial nod. 

BURLESQUE_DVS706
01:47:41,00 --> 01:47:47,50
With her lips pursed in a haughty expression, the diva looks away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS707
01:47:45,00 --> 01:47:52,50
The corner of SOMEONE's mouth twitches in a thoughtful smirk as she continues to watch SOMEONE in the mirror, 

BURLESQUE_DVS708
01:47:49,00 --> 01:47:54,50
then returns to her makeup. 

BURLESQUE_DVS709
01:47:54,00 --> 01:47:59,50
then lowers her gaze, her lips curling into a genial smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS710
01:47:56,00 --> 01:48:02,50
The brunette shoots her another look, 

BURLESQUE_DVS711
01:48:00,00 --> 01:48:06,50
As she stares off dreamily, another dancer reaches for her makeup. 

BURLESQUE_DVS712
01:48:07,00 --> 01:48:13,50
SOMEONE slaps her hands away, her jaw dropping in exasperation. 

BURLESQUE_DVS713
01:48:10,00 --> 01:48:17,50
SOMEONE smiles as she watches in her mirror, then touches up her mascara. 

BURLESQUE_DVS714
01:48:14,00 --> 01:48:19,50
SOMEONE appears in a doorway. 

BURLESQUE_DVS715
01:48:16,00 --> 01:48:21,50
SOMEONE lowers her mascara brush as she sees him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS716
01:48:24,00 --> 01:48:29,50
SOMEONE moves closer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS717
01:48:43,00 --> 01:48:47,50
He gives a pleading look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS718
01:48:45,00 --> 01:48:49,50
SOMEONE avoids his gaze. 

BURLESQUE_DVS719
01:48:49,00 --> 01:48:53,50
He gently lifts her chin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS720
01:48:53,00 --> 01:48:58,50
He stares into her pale-blue eyes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS721
01:49:01,00 --> 01:49:07,50
With her head tilted, SOMEONE shifts her gaze over his face. 

BURLESQUE_DVS723
01:49:05,00 --> 01:49:09,50
he opens his mouth to speak, 

BURLESQUE_DVS724
01:49:06,00 --> 01:49:10,50
then closes it again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS725
01:49:26,00 --> 01:49:31,50
His face scrunches up as he gives a charming grin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS726
01:49:30,00 --> 01:49:35,50
Glancing away, SOMEONE bites her lip. 

BURLESQUE_DVS727
01:49:49,00 --> 01:49:57,50
He leans in and they kiss. SOMEONE presses her hands to his toned chest, then wraps her arms around his neck. 

BURLESQUE_DVS728
01:49:54,00 --> 01:50:00,50
He clutches her shoulders, returning the embrace. 

BURLESQUE_DVS729
01:49:59,00 --> 01:50:06,50
They part and SOMEONE slides her hands back down his chest as he presses his lips to her 

BURLESQUE_DVS731
01:50:04,00 --> 01:50:10,50
He moves in to kiss her again, then pulls back with a smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS732
01:50:09,00 --> 01:50:13,50
He steps away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS733
01:50:13,00 --> 01:50:17,50
He grins widely. 

BURLESQUE_DVS734
01:50:14,00 --> 01:50:19,50
Heading for the door, he pauses. 

BURLESQUE_DVS735
01:50:30,00 --> 01:50:36,50
He walks back to her and hands her some sheet music. 

BURLESQUE_DVS736
01:50:36,00 --> 01:50:42,50
The title reads, Show Me How You Burlesque, by SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS737
01:50:39,00 --> 01:50:47,50
Now on a dark stage, a spotlight shines down on SOMEONE, who wears a sparkling outfit and her platinum wig. 

BURLESQUE_DVS738
01:51:06,00 --> 01:51:17,50
Strobe lights flash and giant block letters spelling Burlesque light up onstage. As the other dancers grind against the letters, SOMEONE sits atop the E at the center. 

BURLESQUE_DVS739
01:51:44,00 --> 01:51:49,50
More girls dance on tables in the audience. 

BURLESQUE_DVS741
01:51:55,00 --> 01:52:09,50
The dancers on the tables swing their arms and flip their hair. The stage performers mirror them. With a smile, the doorman bobs his head. SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch proudly from the balcony. Onstage, the dancers pump their chests. 

BURLESQUE_DVS742
01:52:29,00 --> 01:52:44,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sing backup from atop the bar. More dancers strut out from the revolving mirrored panels behind them. Another girl tickles the doorman's lips and he smiles. An outline of red neon flashes around the letters onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS743
01:52:45,00 --> 01:52:52,50
The dancers on the bar fall back into the arms of the bartenders, who carry them to the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS744
01:52:50,00 --> 01:52:55,50
All of the girls cluster together, with SOMEONE at the center. 

BURLESQUE_DVS745
01:52:52,00 --> 01:52:58,50
They each strike a pose, coolly snapping their fingers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS746
01:53:08,00 --> 01:53:13,50
Several bartenders run onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS747
01:53:13,00 --> 01:53:18,50
They surround SOMEONE and grind their hips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS748
01:53:17,00 --> 01:53:22,50
The women sit on some steps in front of her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS749
01:53:26,00 --> 01:53:34,50
The male and female dancers now stand staggered on the staircase, moving in unison. 

BURLESQUE_DVS750
01:53:31,00 --> 01:53:38,50
As they shake their butts at the audience, SOMEONE imitates them and SOMEONE grins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS751
01:53:35,00 --> 01:53:41,50
The dancers hop from foot to foot, their hands beckoning the audience. 

BURLESQUE_DVS752
01:53:43,00 --> 01:53:53,50
The stage lights flash and the dancers disappear, leaving only the glowing letters. Remaining opening titles: Dianna Agron, 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS25
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:55,50
The bare-chested soldier watches the students halt at the end of the SOMEONE. A live young woman with wavy, corn silk hair, sets her purse on the railing. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS26
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:02,50
A boyish guy sits on the railings, sending her purse plunging into the water. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS27
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:32,50
As SOMEONE jogs up the SOMEONE toward the beach, the soldier jumps off the railing and plummets 15 feet into the water. The blonde's jaw drops. Underwater, the soldier swims down along the SOMEONE's barnacled supports. The purse stirs in the current, on the SOMEONE strewn ocean floor. The soldier seizes it, then kicks off the bottom and shoots back to the surface. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS28
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:39,50
The soldier swims toward the beach. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS29
00:03:36,00 --> 00:03:44,50
On the sand, SOMEONE kicks off his flip-flops, and trots into the water, meeting the soldier in the surf. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS30
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:54,50
The soldier delivers it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS31
00:03:53,00 --> 00:03:58,50
The smiling woman shakes her drenched bag. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS32
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:18,50
SOMEONE ambles off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS33
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:25,50
SOMEONE halts and walks back toward them. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS34
00:04:47,00 --> 00:04:51,50
He grabs his surfboard. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS35
00:04:54,00 --> 00:05:01,50
As SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE, he accidentally bangs his board on the SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS36
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:03,50
They head off side by side. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS37
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:06,50
The setting sun casts long shadows over the sand. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS38
00:05:04,00 --> 00:05:08,50
Dear SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS39
00:05:05,00 --> 00:05:12,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE Porter, and SOMEONE Jenkins. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS40
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:15,50
Now a date appears. Spring 2001. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS41
00:05:13,00 --> 00:05:22,50
Guests mill about a SOMEONE beach house's natural un-landscaped yard. SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in an unlit fire pit. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS42
00:05:35,00 --> 00:05:40,50
SOMEONE notices a bulky ring on SOMEONE's finger. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS43
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:47,50
SOMEONE brings SOMEONE a beer. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS44
00:05:56,00 --> 00:06:01,50
SOMEONE mimes throwing punches. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS45
00:06:01,00 --> 00:06:05,50
SOMEONE eyes him, coolly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS46
00:06:04,00 --> 00:06:08,50
SOMEONE salutes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS47
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:11,50
He leaves. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS48
00:06:08,00 --> 00:06:14,50
SOMEONE hangs his head with a subdued smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS49
00:06:22,00 --> 00:06:28,50
SOMEONE regards SOMEONE candidly. Then allows a smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS50
00:06:25,00 --> 00:06:29,50
He looks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS51
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:37,50
A tow-headed boy hugs her from behind. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS52
00:06:39,00 --> 00:06:44,50
The young boy beams. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS53
00:06:46,00 --> 00:06:51,50
SOMEONE peers downward. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS54
00:06:54,00 --> 00:06:58,50
A bearded man joins them. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS55
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:10,50
SOMEONE plays with some driftwood. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS56
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:24,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS57
00:07:28,00 --> 00:07:34,50
SOMEONE climbs over a log bench, and heads off with his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS58
00:07:32,00 --> 00:07:36,50
He looks over his shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS59
00:07:37,00 --> 00:07:44,50
SOMEONE gapes, and SOMEONE gives a stunned smirk. SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit back down. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS60
00:07:55,00 --> 00:08:02,50
SOMEONE drops his gaze, and SOMEONE studies him with a warm smile. They lock eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS62
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE ramble toward the water. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS63
00:08:20,00 --> 00:08:26,50
They halt among tufted beach grass, and gaze up at the moon. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS64
00:08:41,00 --> 00:08:46,50
As he demonstrates, she copies him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS65
00:08:46,00 --> 00:08:51,50
She covers the moon with her thumb. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS66
00:08:48,00 --> 00:08:53,50
SOMEONE watches enviously from the fire pit. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS67
00:08:56,00 --> 00:09:05,50
Later, SOMEONE whacks a striker bar against a magnesium strip key-chain, instantly igniting a small campfire. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS69
00:09:12,00 --> 00:09:18,50
Holding a hotdog on a stick, SOMEONE grins. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS70
00:09:39,00 --> 00:09:46,50
SOMEONE bashfully glances at the fire and turns away. Then faces SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS71
00:09:57,00 --> 00:10:02,50
She nods, beaming. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS72
00:10:07,00 --> 00:10:13,50
He missteps, almost tripping into the fire. Then affects a cool recovery. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS73
00:10:17,00 --> 00:10:25,50
Later, SOMEONE hobbles down a deserted road in his flip-flops, carrying his surfboard under one arm. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS74
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:29,50
A pickup slows beside him. It's SOMEONE. SOMEONE ride shotgun. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS75
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:39,50
He stumbles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS76
00:10:46,00 --> 00:10:52,50
SOMEONE loads his board into the bed of the truck. Later they drive. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS77
00:11:19,00 --> 00:11:24,50
SOMEONE points at SOMEONE with a nod. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS78
00:11:27,00 --> 00:11:38,50
SOMEONE sways capriciously and tickles the men's necks. Now the truck stops before a modest home with a bushy tree in the front yard. SOMEONE climbs out. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS79
00:12:16,00 --> 00:12:20,50
SOMEONE heads off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS80
00:12:26,00 --> 00:12:30,50
He carries his board toward the house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS81
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:36,50
Now, SOMEONE opens the front door and enters a room veiled in shadow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS82
00:12:36,00 --> 00:12:50,50
In a study, a balding man wearing a single white glove examines a coin under a magnifying glass. SOMEONE lifts the edge of a window shade covering the room's French door, and peeks inside at his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS83
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:53,50
The oblivious man's gaze remains locked on his coin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS84
00:12:51,00 --> 00:12:56,50
SOMEONE lets go of the shade and walks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS85
00:12:53,00 --> 00:12:59,50
His father glances over his shoulder, then stares off glumly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS86
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:01,50
SOMEONE heads into his room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS88
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:05,50
Outside, laundry whips on a line in the wind. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS89
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:09,50
In the kitchen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS90
00:13:19,00 --> 00:13:30,50
SOMEONE's father purses his lips into a thoughtful frown, and digs in his pocket. He pulls out a set of keys and hands them to SOMEONE, who ambles toward the door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS91
00:13:29,00 --> 00:13:36,50
Later, a sign on a shabby seaside building reads, Bowens Island Restaurant. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS92
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:52,50
Loitering men spot SOMEONE and swap looks. A goateed guy speaks up. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS93
00:13:50,00 --> 00:13:54,50
SOMEONE inches over to him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS94
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:11,50
SOMEONE joins a puzzled SOMEONE a few steps ahead of him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS95
00:14:08,00 --> 00:14:12,50
Later in the restaurant. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS96
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:24,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE blankly, and offers a fleeting grin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS97
00:14:23,00 --> 00:14:27,50
She smiles back. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS98
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:33,50
At twilight, two men fish on the dock outside the restaurant. Back inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS99
00:14:59,00 --> 00:15:03,50
She smiles quizzically. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS100
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:14,50
He munches some food. Eyes the rosy-cheeked young woman, then shyly bows his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS101
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:22,50
SOMEONE locks her in his sudden sobered gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS102
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:24,50
Later, they stroll toward his front door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS103
00:15:28,00 --> 00:15:32,50
They head inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS104
00:15:32,00 --> 00:15:37,50
SOMEONE's father looks up from his desk. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS105
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:40,50
He stands to greet them. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS106
00:15:41,00 --> 00:15:45,50
She extends a hand. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS107
00:15:43,00 --> 00:15:48,50
He bashfully shakes it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS108
00:15:46,00 --> 00:15:50,50
She notices a coin collection. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS109
00:16:05,00 --> 00:16:09,50
He takes a coin from her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS110
00:16:11,00 --> 00:16:17,50
He rubs it vigorously on his shirt. Then peers at her through his glasses. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS111
00:16:23,00 --> 00:16:27,50
He gives her a white cotton glove. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS112
00:16:47,00 --> 00:16:52,50
He covers a wheel printed on the coin with a silver dollar. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS113
00:17:07,00 --> 00:17:11,50
He brings out more. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS114
00:17:20,00 --> 00:17:28,50
Now the SOMEONE family car pulls up in front of SOMEONE's house. Riding with SOMEONE, she beams. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS115
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:45,50
SOMEONE chews his pursed lips. Leaning over, SOMEONE gives him a kiss on the cheek. Then gets out of the car. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS116
00:17:51,00 --> 00:17:57,50
SOMEONE grins at him and shuts the door. He happily gazes after her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS118
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:05,50
At the beach, SOMEONE paddles his surfboard out over the breaking waves. He crests one, then swims farther out. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS119
00:18:03,00 --> 00:18:17,50
Later, he paddles with a flow of a swelling wave, as its foaming crest reaches his board, he gets to his feet and surfs it until it breaks. Later, he sits straddling his board, gazing at the houses along the shore. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS120
00:18:16,00 --> 00:18:22,50
Later still, he paddles out past a stone jetty. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS121
00:18:19,00 --> 00:18:26,50
At her house, SOMEONE steps out on her screened-in porch, and gazes toward the beach. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS122
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:29,50
Now she walks with SOMEONE, as he carries his board from the water. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS123
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:44,50
They stroll toward her home. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS124
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:49,50
Now they approach a partially constructed house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS126
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:13,50
Later, she leads him through the house's framework. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS127
00:20:32,00 --> 00:20:36,50
It starts to rain. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS128
00:20:40,00 --> 00:20:45,50
She leads him under a cluster of boards supported by a beam. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS129
00:20:49,00 --> 00:20:54,50
They stand close together. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS130
00:20:55,00 --> 00:20:59,50
She strokes his eyebrow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS131
00:20:57,00 --> 00:21:02,50
Looking away, SOMEONE works his mouth. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS132
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:10,50
SOMEONE shrugs. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS133
00:21:24,00 --> 00:21:30,50
SOMEONE rests his cheek against the side of the beam. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS134
00:21:56,00 --> 00:22:04,50
SOMEONE gazes tenderly at SOMEONE. He leans his face closer to her, and she smiles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS135
00:22:01,00 --> 00:22:07,50
She lifts her chin and her nose brushes against his. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS136
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:09,50
Opening her mouth, she kisses him hungrily. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS137
00:22:09,00 --> 00:22:21,50
SOMEONE drapes her arms around his neck, as they passionately make out. He lifts her up, and she wraps her legs around him. As SOMEONE lowers himself to the floor, she straddles his lap. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS138
00:22:28,00 --> 00:22:41,50
Now, as they walk down a sidewalk, SOMEONE clasps SOMEONE's hand to his chest. At the sun dappled construction site, SOMEONE arrives to find him working at the top of a ladder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS139
00:22:38,00 --> 00:22:43,50
She stops, watching him appreciatively. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS140
00:22:41,00 --> 00:22:46,50
He spots her, and they share a warm smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS141
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:58,50
Now, SOMEONE holds his surfboard, tucked under his arm as they trod into the ocean. Later a wet-suit clad SOMEONE, crouches low on the board as she awkwardly rides a wave. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS142
00:22:55,00 --> 00:23:10,50
Tumbling into the shallow water, she grins. From the shore, her female friend pouts beside SOMEONE, who sullenly watches the couple. Trying another wave, SOMEONE manages to stand briefly as SOMEONE cheers her on. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS143
00:23:07,00 --> 00:23:17,50
Now, she hugs his arm as they walk hand in hand past a cafe. At the SOMEONE house, the young couple enjoys a meal with SOMEONE's father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS144
00:23:15,00 --> 00:23:24,50
Later, silhouetted by a dusky sky, SOMEONE frolics on the beach, playfully evading SOMEONE's grasp. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS145
00:23:21,00 --> 00:23:34,50
He finally catches her in his arms. Lifts her and spins. At the construction site, the couple adds a plywood board to a wall. She swats her hand in front of him, as he hammers it in place. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS146
00:23:46,00 --> 00:23:52,50
In a living room, SOMEONE sings and plays guitar for SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS147
00:23:55,00 --> 00:24:04,50
In a hallway, SOMEONE sneaks up on her as she shuts a door. He turns her to face him, and they share a tender kiss. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS148
00:24:01,00 --> 00:24:06,50
SOMEONE peeks around a corner. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS149
00:24:06,00 --> 00:24:14,50
As his father paces in the living room, SOMEONE carries his girlfriend upstairs. Now they tumble unto his bed. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS151
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:20,50
Mr. SOMEONE slows, blinking. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS152
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:26,50
He gives a startled turn, then stares off. His brow knitted. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS153
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:31,50
Upstairs SOMEONE rolls off the bed, then scrambles to a closet and shuts herself in. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS154
00:24:31,00 --> 00:24:36,50
She pulls at the door knobs, but he yanks the doors open. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS155
00:24:34,00 --> 00:24:38,50
Pouncing at her side, he tickles her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS156
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:43,50
As our view drifts upward, his armed uniform obscures them from view. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS157
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:49,50
Back in the living room, SOMEONE smiles as she plays the guitar. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS158
00:24:49,00 --> 00:24:54,50
Reclining beside her, SOMEONE beams appreciatively. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS159
00:24:51,00 --> 00:25:05,50
Now, tall reeds wave in a breeze as the young man hikes into view, and gazes ahead. On the beach, a small group plays volleyball amidst a boisterous party. Near a grill, SOMEONE pats SOMEONE's shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS160
00:25:06,00 --> 00:25:12,50
Another group sits around two young men playing acoustic guitars. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS161
00:25:10,00 --> 00:25:16,50
SOMEONE hangs back, pensively taking in the cheerful scene. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS162
00:25:13,00 --> 00:25:20,50
Turning, he spots a solitary figure sitting alone at the base of a grassy dune. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS163
00:25:20,00 --> 00:25:29,50
At the volleyball net, SOMEONE pauses. He watches his rival cross to the dune, then turns back to his game. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS164
00:25:26,00 --> 00:25:36,50
SOMEONE hikes along a grassy ridge towards SOMEONE, and sneaks down behind her. He playfully grabs her side, startling the live young beauty. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS165
00:25:55,00 --> 00:26:00,50
She smiles contentedly in his arms. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS166
00:26:29,00 --> 00:26:34,50
SOMEONE lowers her troubled gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS167
00:26:31,00 --> 00:26:36,50
Pulling her closer, SOMEONE kisses her brow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS168
00:26:38,00 --> 00:26:43,50
He rocks her in his arms. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS169
00:26:50,00 --> 00:26:56,50
Her lips creep into a faint smile, and he kisses her brow again. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS170
00:26:55,00 --> 00:27:01,50
Turning, SOMEONE wraps her arms around him and lays him back against the dune. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS171
00:27:01,00 --> 00:27:06,50
Later, they stroll toward the party. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS172
00:27:03,00 --> 00:27:14,50
SOMEONE trots ahead a few paces and bends to pick up a seashell. As she straightens and pockets it, SOMEONE drapes a loving arm around her shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS173
00:27:42,00 --> 00:27:47,50
He stops and faces her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS174
00:28:03,00 --> 00:28:08,50
SOMEONE lowers her gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS175
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:44,50
SOMEONE starts to speak, then turns away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS176
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:48,50
He sulks off, leaving his girlfriend behind. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS177
00:28:45,00 --> 00:28:50,50
Reaching the party, he heads up a boardwalk. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS178
00:28:51,00 --> 00:28:55,50
SOMEONE tosses him a can. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS179
00:28:54,00 --> 00:28:58,50
SOMEONE chucks it aside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS180
00:29:00,00 --> 00:29:04,50
SOMEONE pulls him aside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS181
00:29:09,00 --> 00:29:18,50
He touches SOMEONE's chest. The soldier flings him to the ground. His buddy runs over, and SOMEONE punches him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS182
00:29:15,00 --> 00:29:22,50
SOMEONE rushes up behind the soldier. SOMEONE elbows him in the face. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS183
00:29:19,00 --> 00:29:29,50
Glaring lividly, SOMEONE smacks his arm. SOMEONE faces her briefly, then leaves. SOMEONE cups a hand over his nose. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS184
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:32,50
SOMEONE crouches to him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS185
00:29:29,00 --> 00:29:40,50
At dusk, SOMEONE hikes along a dirt road. His feature obscured by shadow. An SUV rounds a turn, pulls up beside him, and continues on. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS186
00:29:37,00 --> 00:29:44,50
Silhouetted against the gray sky, SOMEONE bows his head. His stride unbroken. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS188
00:29:45,00 --> 00:29:52,50
Daytime, SOMEONE stands on SOMEONE's porch, knocking on the screen door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS189
00:29:49,00 --> 00:29:56,50
In the next yard, SOMEONE takes out the trash, sporting a black eye and a swollen nose. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS190
00:29:59,00 --> 00:30:03,50
SOMEONE approaches him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS191
00:30:05,00 --> 00:30:10,50
SOMEONE shrugs his hand and steps forward. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS192
00:30:07,00 --> 00:30:12,50
Getting a look at his face, SOMEONE slows. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS193
00:30:44,00 --> 00:30:50,50
SOMEONE fishes a scrap of paper from the trash bin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS194
00:30:48,00 --> 00:30:54,50
SOMEONE meets the kind man who hands him the paper with a pen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS195
00:30:55,00 --> 00:30:59,50
SOMEONE nods, and steps away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS196
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:04,50
Now an oven door opens, revealing two pans of lasagna. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS197
00:31:01,00 --> 00:31:09,50
A pair of hands and oven mitts take them out and sets them on a stove. SOMEONE wanders into the kitchen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS198
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:33,50
SOMEONE shuffles into the dining room. His father closes the oven door, crosses to an island counter and watches him. The young man clears one of three place settings from the dining room table. Taking it into the kitchen, he sets the plate, place mat and glass on the island. His father looks on as he starts to put the silverware away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS199
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:45,50
SOMEONE puts the silverware back down. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS200
00:31:44,00 --> 00:31:50,50
As he steps away, Mr. SOMEONE methodically sets the silverware aside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS201
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:58,50
He picks up the plate in both hands. Sets it at a precise angle in a wooden case, and slides a glass door close in front of it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS202
00:31:55,00 --> 00:32:05,50
Later, we watch through a doorway, as father and son eat at the dining room table. SOMEONE gazes off as he chews, then looks down at his plate. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS203
00:32:07,00 --> 00:32:12,50
His father picks at his food. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS204
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:17,50
SOMEONE watches him with a concerned expression. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS205
00:32:14,00 --> 00:32:22,50
With a melancholy stare, Mr. SOMEONE scoops a large fork full of lasagna into his mouth and chews. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS206
00:32:22,00 --> 00:32:32,50
He turns, facing a window. SOMEONE follows his gaze to find SOMEONE's car pulling up outside. Standing, he leaves the table. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS207
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:41,50
He goes outside and jogs down off the porch. Getting out of her car, SOMEONE faces him with an affectionate smirk. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS208
00:32:44,00 --> 00:32:47,50
They embrace. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS209
00:33:11,00 --> 00:33:15,50
He caresses her corn silk hair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS210
00:33:14,00 --> 00:33:19,50
He kisses her smooth forehead. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS211
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:21,50
She warps her arms around him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS212
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:29,50
She gives him an envelope and he starts to open it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS213
00:33:46,00 --> 00:33:52,50
He drapes an arm around her shoulder and she hugs his waist as they head inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS214
00:33:57,00 --> 00:34:01,50
Now they eat dinner with SOMEONE's father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS215
00:34:02,00 --> 00:34:09,50
Later as SOMEONE sits in her car, SOMEONE leans through the window and playfully grapples with her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS216
00:34:07,00 --> 00:34:17,50
She turns her face toward his and kisses him. In the house, Mr. SOMEONE looks up from his coins. A window shows SOMEONE's car pulling away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS217
00:34:18,00 --> 00:34:23,50
SOMEONE gazes after her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS218
00:34:23,00 --> 00:34:29,50
His image recedes as she drives away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS219
00:34:26,00 --> 00:34:32,50
With glistening eyes, SOMEONE watches him through her rear-view mirror. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS220
00:34:29,00 --> 00:34:34,50
She tearfully looks away, and watches the road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS221
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:36,50
Now at a bus station. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS222
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:44,50
He takes two bags from his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS223
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:50,50
The young man boards a waiting bus. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS224
00:34:48,00 --> 00:34:58,50
Its long side window shows Mr. SOMEONE lingering on the spot, staring off as he stuffs his hands into his pockets. The bus pulls away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS225
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:12,50
On the bus, SOMEONE reads SOMEONE's letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS226
00:35:17,00 --> 00:35:23,50
Now amongst sleeping soldiers, SOMEONE reads by flashlight. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS227
00:35:24,00 --> 00:35:28,50
Daytime at an airfield. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS228
00:35:30,00 --> 00:35:37,50
The soldiers file off a plane in their camouflaged uniforms. Each carrying a duffel. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS229
00:35:34,00 --> 00:35:41,50
SOMEONE exits the aircraft, squinting in the sun and proceeds across the tarmac. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS231
00:35:50,00 --> 00:35:55,50
He eyes one of his peers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS232
00:35:54,00 --> 00:35:59,50
The dark-haired soldier stares defeatedly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS233
00:36:12,00 --> 00:36:24,50
Their mustached superior leaves. SOMEONE lowers his gaze. At dusk, the platoon crosses the airfield and climbs the boarding steps of a cargo plane. On board, SOMEONE writes a letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS234
00:36:32,00 --> 00:36:38,50
Now a helicopter descends. SOMEONE rides on board among the others. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS235
00:36:39,00 --> 00:36:43,50
He gazes at passing trees. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS236
00:36:43,00 --> 00:36:53,50
The soldiers hop out of the landed chopper, one by one. Now they enter a crude village where a calf drinks from ruts of sitting water. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS237
00:37:02,00 --> 00:37:06,50
He hands a letter to a pilot. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS238
00:37:07,00 --> 00:37:12,50
SOMEONE watches the helicopter take off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS239
00:37:25,00 --> 00:37:50,50
Now multiple letters travel along four conveyor belts. One of them addressed to SOMEONE Curtis. Letters flip vertically through a machine. A bin of bundled letters slides down a track, and a postal worker sorts the letters into cubbies. On a college campus, a mailman takes a few letters from his satchel and places them into one of many PO boxes. From inside the PO box, we see SOMEONE take out her mail. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS240
00:37:48,00 --> 00:37:54,50
On finding SOMEONE's letter, she smiles.  

DEAR_JOHN_DVS241
00:37:57,00 --> 00:38:02,50
She reads on her way to class. SOMEONE instructs African troops.  

DEAR_JOHN_DVS242
00:38:14,00 --> 00:38:19,50
In a lecture, SOMEONE sees SOMEONE reading. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS243
00:38:17,00 --> 00:38:23,50
SOMEONE's dark-haired buddy goes through the newly receive mail. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS244
00:38:32,00 --> 00:38:36,50
SOMEONE reads. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS245
00:38:34,00 --> 00:38:49,50
Now, African women play drums and dance. Soldiers walk among merchants set up along a dirt road. A soldier in sunglasses chats with two local men. Another soldier exits a house and pats SOMEONE, who sits on a porch reading. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS246
00:38:56,00 --> 00:39:02,50
SOMEONE leaves a horse and runs across the front yard to greet SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS247
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:05,50
She picks him up and twirls. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS248
00:39:05,00 --> 00:39:08,50
Now they ride horses. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS252
00:39:13,00 --> 00:39:17,50
She grins at the boy. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS253
00:39:36,00 --> 00:39:42,50
Leaning on a fence, SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch SOMEONE feed a horse. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS254
00:39:53,00 --> 00:39:57,50
SOMEONE writes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS255
00:39:57,00 --> 00:40:03,50
SOMEONE reads attentively. Nighttime in a tent. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS256
00:40:07,00 --> 00:40:14,50
SOMEONE grabs the letter from him. Now SOMEONE receives another. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS257
00:40:37,00 --> 00:40:41,50
She gazes at the moon. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS258
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:50,50
She covers the moon with her thumb. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS259
00:40:52,00 --> 00:40:57,50
Her cheeks flushed. She holds her gaze steady. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS260
00:40:54,00 --> 00:40:59,50
Now at Mr. SOMEONE's house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS261
00:40:58,00 --> 00:41:02,50
He hesitates at the door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS262
00:41:36,00 --> 00:41:42,50
He retrieves a small case from a lower drawer. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS263
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:45,50
Then takes out a coin, which he holds under a magnifying glass. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS264
00:41:42,00 --> 00:41:48,50
Flipping the nickel over, he reveals the back of a penny. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS265
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:14,50
He glances around the desk, and finds another coin. SOMEONE smiles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS266
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:22,50
Riding in the bed of a transport truck, SOMEONE reads "What's the story?". 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS268
00:42:21,00 --> 00:42:25,50
He stares off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS269
00:42:26,00 --> 00:42:33,50
In a flashback, a boy receives a handful of change from an ice-cream vendor. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS270
00:42:33,00 --> 00:42:38,50
Leaving the van, the boy studies his change. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS271
00:42:39,00 --> 00:42:44,50
Young SOMEONE licks his ice-cream cone. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS272
00:42:41,00 --> 00:42:47,50
Later his dad's fingers rinse the peculiar coin under the faucet. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS273
00:42:44,00 --> 00:42:51,50
In the kitchen, a younger Mr. SOMEONE studies the coin and shakes his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS274
00:42:54,00 --> 00:42:58,50
He glances at the boy. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS275
00:42:59,00 --> 00:43:03,50
Now at a pawn shop. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS276
00:43:28,00 --> 00:43:34,50
SOMEONE brightens, his grin missing a couple baby teeth. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS277
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:40,50
Mr. SOMEONE collects the coin and tugs his son away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS278
00:43:39,00 --> 00:43:46,50
Mr. SOMEONE hurries down a sidewalk and briefly stops for SOMEONE to catch up. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS279
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:47,50
In another store. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS280
00:43:49,00 --> 00:43:59,50
The clerk sets the coin on a square napkin. Bends down and digs under his counter to retrieve a pamphlet titled, The Four Thousand Dollar Mule. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS281
00:44:21,00 --> 00:44:25,50
Mr. SOMEONE looks at his son. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS282
00:44:26,00 --> 00:44:30,50
SOMEONE nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS283
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:32,50
The clerk grins. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS284
00:44:31,00 --> 00:44:35,50
Now at another coin shop. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS285
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:45,50
They view coins on display. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS286
00:44:45,00 --> 00:44:49,50
We tour a collection. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS287
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:57,50
Now older SOMEONE takes milk out of the fridge. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS288
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:00,50
He drinks from the carton. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS289
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:11,50
He tosses the carton back inside and shuts the door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS290
00:45:08,00 --> 00:45:14,50
His father opens the door and stands the carton upright. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS291
00:45:11,00 --> 00:45:16,50
Now Mr. SOMEONE studies a coin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS292
00:45:17,00 --> 00:45:22,50
SOMEONE goes to a stereo in the living room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS293
00:45:22,00 --> 00:45:31,50
His father looks up from a coin. Seen distantly through the doorway, SOMEONE leaves the stereo and walks out of sight. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS294
00:45:31,00 --> 00:45:36,50
His dad glances over his shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS295
00:45:36,00 --> 00:45:52,50
On campus, a passing student bumps into SOMEONE as she reads. At the bottom of a staircase, she reaches a walkway where frantic peers gather and talk on cellphones. A confused SOMEONE holds SOMEONE's letter with both hands as she observes the anxious activity. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS296
00:45:55,00 --> 00:46:24,50
As SOMEONE remains frozen, our view is sent to take in a bird's eye view of the chaos. Now wearing plain clothes, SOMEONE walks alone on a busy street in an eastern European town. A horse-drawn cart, a woman on a bicycle, and a man on a scooter crosses path. SOMEONE approaches a cafe, where pedestrians gather outside. Reaching the entrance, SOMEONE joins his dark-haired buddy to watch television news coverage. Black smoke billows from one of New York City's Twin Towers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS297
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:27,50
SOMEONE breathes heavily as he watches SOMEONE falling off the building. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS298
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:28,50
Fade to black. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS299
00:46:26,00 --> 00:46:32,50
Now in a hanger, the soldier’s superior approaches. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS300
00:46:36,00 --> 00:46:40,50
SOMEONE packs. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS301
00:46:40,00 --> 00:46:44,50
SOMEONE's friend rises. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS302
00:47:09,00 --> 00:47:15,50
SOMEONE, the only one left seated, lowers his gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS303
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:19,50
Later in a conference room, he shakes hands with two soldiers then grabs his bag. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS304
00:47:36,00 --> 00:47:41,50
He eyes his dark-haired friend. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS305
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:50,50
Now a gray cargo plane lands on an airstrip. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS306
00:47:48,00 --> 00:47:55,50
Inside a crowded airport, SOMEONE sees SOMEONE on the other side of a security gate. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS307
00:47:55,00 --> 00:48:06,50
She ducks under a dividing rope, and hurries around to the other side. SOMEONE notices her and beams. She runs to him and leaps into his arms. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS308
00:48:03,00 --> 00:48:08,50
As he spins her around, they kiss. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS309
00:48:05,00 --> 00:48:11,50
A heavy-set traveler eyes them as he takes off his belt. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS310
00:48:08,00 --> 00:48:14,50
Another man eyes them, holding out his arms for a guard. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS311
00:48:12,00 --> 00:48:25,50
Later while SOMEONE drives, SOMEONE raises her free hand to his lips. He rubs her hand with his chin, then she strokes the back of his head, fondle his ear, and caresses his cheek. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS312
00:48:23,00 --> 00:48:34,50
SOMEONE brushes her long blonde hair behind her shoulder. As he gazes at her, thumbing her hair around her ear, she meets his gaze and smiles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS313
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:36,50
Now, outside his father's house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS314
00:48:40,00 --> 00:48:44,50
They approach the front door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS315
00:48:47,00 --> 00:48:53,50
Inside, Mr. SOMEONE sits on a chair and buttons a suit jacket. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS316
00:48:50,00 --> 00:48:56,50
Behind him, the front door opens, and the couple enters. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS317
00:48:57,00 --> 00:49:02,50
SOMEONE walks off, then returns to the sitting room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS319
00:49:19,00 --> 00:49:24,50
They follow him into the kitchen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS320
00:49:29,00 --> 00:49:33,50
He takes out the pan. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS321
00:49:33,00 --> 00:49:46,50
Now Mr. SOMEONE sits in the back seat of SOMEONE's blue Volkswagen, as they drive away. On a country road, he nervously stares at the foiled wrapped meatloaf nestled in a cardboard box on his lap. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS323
00:50:07,00 --> 00:50:13,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE. Mr. SOMEONE squeezes his brow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS324
00:50:18,00 --> 00:50:30,50
Grimacing, he grabs at the door. SOMEONE reaches back. The car stops and Mr. SOMEONE gets out. A disheartened SOMEONE remains in the passenger seat, and rests his elbow on the window sill. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS325
00:50:27,00 --> 00:50:33,50
Mr. SOMEONE slouches at the side of the road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS326
00:50:41,00 --> 00:50:46,50
She touches his back, and he walks off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS327
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:54,50
He walks a few paces away, then halts and hunches forward, catching his breath. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS328
00:50:52,00 --> 00:50:57,50
Now at the SOMEONE house, they get out of the car. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS329
00:51:03,00 --> 00:51:07,50
Mr. SOMEONE goes to the front door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS330
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:11,50
His father pauses. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS331
00:51:15,00 --> 00:51:19,50
He enters the house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS332
00:51:18,00 --> 00:51:25,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE, rolls his eyes, then returns to the car. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS333
00:51:22,00 --> 00:51:26,50
Later on the road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS334
00:51:25,00 --> 00:51:30,50
SOMEONE meets her gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS335
00:51:30,00 --> 00:51:35,50
They both stare ahead somberly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS336
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:39,50
Now SOMEONE's car pulls onto a private road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS337
00:51:37,00 --> 00:51:47,50
A stylish brunette woman in a white dress, crosses the front porch of a colonial plantation home, and greets arriving guests as she passes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS338
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:52,50
She hugs SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS339
00:52:01,00 --> 00:52:09,50
Well over a dozen cars sit parked on the front lawn. Inside, guests mingle over drinks and hor d'oeuvres. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS340
00:52:22,00 --> 00:52:27,50
SOMEONE offers his hand. SOMEONE ignores him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS341
00:52:44,00 --> 00:52:49,50
SOMEONE returns and offers SOMEONE a drink. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS342
00:52:52,00 --> 00:52:57,50
SOMEONE takes the drink and averts his gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS343
00:53:08,00 --> 00:53:12,50
SOMEONE nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS344
00:53:16,00 --> 00:53:21,50
A cigar-smoking man approaches SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS345
00:53:47,00 --> 00:53:52,50
As her father leaves, SOMEONE joins them. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS346
00:53:52,00 --> 00:53:56,50
A blonde woman joins them. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS347
00:54:05,00 --> 00:54:09,50
The woman and SOMEONE leave. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS348
00:54:09,00 --> 00:54:14,50
The boy collects hor d'oeuvres on a plate. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS349
00:54:15,00 --> 00:54:20,50
SOMEONE looks around self-consciously. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS350
00:54:20,00 --> 00:54:24,50
SOMEONE sips his bourbon. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS351
00:54:58,00 --> 00:55:02,50
SOMEONE nods and glances off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS352
00:55:11,00 --> 00:55:15,50
SOMEONE nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS353
00:55:40,00 --> 00:55:45,50
SOMEONE eyes him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS354
00:55:43,00 --> 00:55:47,50
SOMEONE deflates. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS355
00:55:46,00 --> 00:55:52,50
Now on the porch, SOMEONE paces behind SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS356
00:55:49,00 --> 00:55:59,50
She leans on the railing, gazing out over the lawn as departing guests find their cars. He stands behind her, and she lowers her gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS357
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:02,50
She flinches and shifts away from him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS358
00:55:59,00 --> 00:56:04,50
SOMEONE bows his head and faces her from the side. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS359
00:56:15,00 --> 00:56:20,50
She looks at him ascant, then faces him fully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS360
00:56:29,00 --> 00:56:35,50
She grimaces, agonizing and SOMEONE lowers his gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS361
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:51,50
She storms past him and disappears down the front steps, leaving him alone on the porch. SOMEONE watches her go, then swallows hard and hangs his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS362
00:56:53,00 --> 00:57:05,50
Now as guests stroll around the Curtis' expansive grounds, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE siting alone on a bench overlooking a marsh. His pace slows as he draws closer. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS363
00:57:05,00 --> 00:57:10,50
He gazes out at the wetlands as he waits a few feet away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS364
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:22,50
SOMEONE clasps SOMEONE's head in her hands, then wraps her arms around his neck and pulls him into a tight embrace. She rests her chin on his shoulder as he holds her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS365
00:58:22,00 --> 00:58:29,50
She meets his gaze, then draws his face closer and kisses his forehead. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS366
00:58:30,00 --> 00:58:41,50
Leading him by the hand, SOMEONE takes SOMEONE to her family's stables. Inside, she leans back against a wall as she unbuttons his dress shirt. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS367
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:44,50
He caresses her hair, then lovingly kisses her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS368
00:58:46,00 --> 00:58:52,50
Dim blue light outlines SOMEONE's corn silk hair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS369
00:58:54,00 --> 00:59:02,50
SOMEONE nuzzles the top of her head, as he sweeps her long blonde locks behind her back. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS370
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:08,50
She parts his shirt, and slips it off his shoulders. Then wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him hungrily. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS371
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:19,50
As SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE's neck, she lowers her dress and presses her body against his. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS372
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:25,50
Now, SOMEONE's toned upper body hovers above SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS373
00:59:23,00 --> 00:59:29,50
Propped up by his arms, as she pulls his undershirt over his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS374
00:59:27,00 --> 00:59:31,50
She then removes her bra. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS375
00:59:31,00 --> 00:59:38,50
He lowers himself on top of her, and meets her lips with a passionate kiss. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS376
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:43,50
The muscles in his shoulders ripple as he and SOMEONE make love. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS377
00:59:44,00 --> 00:59:53,50
He kisses her shoulder, then trails his lips from the tip of her chin, down her neck, and gently caresses her hair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS379
00:59:53,00 --> 01:00:02,50
He lies beside her, his arm reaching across her body, to stroke her corn silk tresses with his fingertips. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS380
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:03,50
They kiss sweetly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS381
01:00:03,00 --> 01:00:10,50
She stares distantly. Her hand clasping SOMEONE's smooth freckled shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS383
01:00:09,00 --> 01:00:13,50
With a wistful look, she closes her eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS384
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:16,50
A tear slides out. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS385
01:00:13,00 --> 01:00:17,50
Glistening in the light. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS386
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:19,50
And rests at the corner of her eye. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS387
01:00:18,00 --> 01:00:26,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold hands as they stroll outside the stable into the daylight. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS388
01:00:25,00 --> 01:00:32,50
SOMEONE carries her heels, and she wears his jacket over her dress. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS389
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:39,50
A wider view shows warm sunlight glinting through Spanish moss on a tree, as the couple embraces in front of the stables. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS390
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:45,50
Now wearing his fatigues, SOMEONE enters the airport with SOMEONE by his side. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS391
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:48,50
He spots his father waiting at a security checkpoint. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS392
01:00:45,00 --> 01:00:51,50
As the couple draws closer, a grin crosses SOMEONE's face. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS393
01:00:53,00 --> 01:00:58,50
Mr. SOMEONE smiles briefly, but avoids his gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS394
01:00:56,00 --> 01:01:02,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE, who grins at Mr. SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS395
01:01:04,00 --> 01:01:10,50
SOMEONE shares a quick look with SOMEONE, who turns away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS396
01:01:07,00 --> 01:01:11,50
He faces his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS397
01:01:16,00 --> 01:01:20,50
They exchange smiles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS398
01:01:18,00 --> 01:01:23,50
Mr. SOMEONE shifts his gaze uneasily. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS399
01:01:28,00 --> 01:01:35,50
SOMEONE extends his hand. With his eyes averted, Mr. SOMEONE shakes it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS400
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:47,50
The soldier awkwardly watches his father, then turns to SOMEONE, who waits a few steps away. As she faces SOMEONE, Mr. SOMEONE walks past them and exits the airport. SOMEONE bends down and wraps his arms around SOMEONE's waist. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS401
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:49,50
They embrace tightly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS402
01:01:50,00 --> 01:01:54,50
SOMEONE straightens. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS403
01:01:57,00 --> 01:02:04,50
Clasping his neck, SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE, then rests her forehead against his. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS404
01:02:02,00 --> 01:02:07,50
He lifts his lips and kisses the top of her head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS405
01:02:05,00 --> 01:02:09,50
She looks up at him, tearfully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS406
01:02:21,00 --> 01:02:26,50
Tears shine in her red rimmed eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS407
01:02:24,00 --> 01:02:30,50
The corner of SOMEONE's mouth twitches into a tiny smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS408
01:02:28,00 --> 01:02:32,50
He and SOMEONE kiss desperately. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS409
01:02:31,00 --> 01:02:40,50
She cups SOMEONE's face in her hands as she kisses him one last time, then turns away and strides out of the airport. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS410
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:43,50
SOMEONE clenches his jaw as he watches her leave. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS411
01:02:40,00 --> 01:02:48,50
Outside, she glances over her shoulder and smiles at him, then continues away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS412
01:02:45,00 --> 01:02:53,50
Now in a military plane, SOMEONE lies on some cargo netting as it takes off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS413
01:02:53,00 --> 01:02:58,50
Later in the hanger on base. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS414
01:03:02,00 --> 01:03:06,50
The captain observes his men. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS415
01:03:05,00 --> 01:03:11,50
Sitting on a crate, SOMEONE furrows his brow thoughtfully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS416
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:15,50
He rises and stands at attention, joining the rest of his team. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS417
01:03:12,00 --> 01:03:16,50
The captain nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS418
01:03:23,00 --> 01:03:31,50
As the captain heads off, our bird's eye view of his men swings down to watch them collect their belongings. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS419
01:03:31,00 --> 01:03:39,50
Now, an image of SOMEONE's address handwritten on an envelope, drifts into view. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS420
01:03:36,00 --> 01:03:42,50
In Afghanistan, SOMEONE patrols a bustling street. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS421
01:03:39,00 --> 01:03:44,50
He pauses to talk to a young boy. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS422
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:48,50
In a close-up of SOMEONE's letter, we glimpse fragments of sentences. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS424
01:03:47,00 --> 01:03:54,50
Just not the same without you. Rises and sets for both of us, is what helps me survive day to day. Love SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS426
01:03:53,00 --> 01:03:58,50
In a college classroom SOMEONE writes thoughtfully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS427
01:03:56,00 --> 01:04:03,50
A close-up shows her pen gracefully filling a page with elegant cursive. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS428
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:08,50
Back in Afghanistan, a pallet drops from a plane, and a parachute opens above it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS429
01:04:10,00 --> 01:04:18,50
Later, two soldiers approach the fallen crate. SOMEONE heads over and receives a mailbag. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS430
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:24,50
At the army camp, he distributes letters to soldiers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS431
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:31,50
With a letter in his hand, SOMEONE sits on a cot. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS432
01:04:29,00 --> 01:04:35,50
Now, a close-up shows a smooth cursive signature. Always SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS434
01:04:33,00 --> 01:04:47,50
SOMEONE drops some letters on top of others in a metal box. Then closes the lid. He kicks it under his cot as he begins to write a reply on a pad of paper. In Charleston, SOMEONE and SOMEONE ride horses together. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS435
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:50,50
Back in Afghanistan, SOMEONE trains another soldier. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS437
01:04:55,00 --> 01:04:59,50
The soldier fires at a target. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS438
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:01,50
SOMEONE pats him on the back. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS439
01:04:58,00 --> 01:05:05,50
Close-ups of a pen show him writing the dates on more letters to SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS440
01:05:02,00 --> 01:05:07,50
June, September, December. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS441
01:05:09,00 --> 01:05:19,50
In Charleston, moonlight shines across SOMEONE's face as she lies awake in bed. Our view of the moon morphs into the blazing sun. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS442
01:05:16,00 --> 01:05:25,50
In Afghanistan, SOMEONE riffles through a pile of letters. With a disappointed look, he turns away from the mailbag. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS443
01:05:23,00 --> 01:05:27,50
Now he cleans a gun. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS444
01:05:24,00 --> 01:05:31,50
Glancing up, he notices a soldier reclined on a cot, and reading a letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS445
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:36,50
In Charleston, SOMEONE sits alone on the beach. She closes her eyes regretfully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS446
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:40,50
In Afghanistan, SOMEONE's dark-haired buddy, passes him with a mailbag. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS447
01:05:43,00 --> 01:05:48,50
SOMEONE hangs his head as the soldier walks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS448
01:05:45,00 --> 01:05:52,50
Now, SOMEONE cautiously glances around as he steps into a tent. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS449
01:05:49,00 --> 01:05:59,50
He finds a cellphone on a desk, and reaches for it. Sitting down, he dials, then lifts the phone to his ear. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS450
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:18,50
Now dust billows as a bundled pallet parachutes to the ground. Later, a soldier opens a mailbag and searches its contents. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS451
01:06:15,00 --> 01:06:25,50
Now, SOMEONE's dark-haired buddy carries a letter in one hand, and the mailbag in the other, as he enters the fenced-in base camp. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS452
01:06:23,00 --> 01:06:32,50
Passing a group of soldiers playing football, he approaches other lounging on picnic tables outside a tent. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS453
01:06:36,00 --> 01:06:40,50
He heads into the tent. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS454
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:43,50
SOMEONE sits at a weight machine. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS455
01:06:45,00 --> 01:06:49,50
He hands SOMEONE the thin envelope. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS456
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:53,50
SOMEONE thoughtfully runs his thumb over it. Gauging its weight. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS457
01:06:50,00 --> 01:06:55,50
Later, he sits outside and reads the letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS458
01:07:33,00 --> 01:07:38,50
SOMEONE trudges into his tent with the letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS459
01:07:38,00 --> 01:07:42,50
He sits on his cot. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS460
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:45,50
SOMEONE glances at the other soldiers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS461
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:52,50
He lowers his miserable gaze to the handwritten pages. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS462
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:56,50
SOMEONE lifts his head into the sunlight, and bites his lip resolutely. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS463
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:03,50
Reaching under his cot, 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS464
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:09,50
he extracts the metal box and carries it outside. As he pries off its cover, he fumbles it, and it falls to the ground. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS465
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:15,50
As SOMEONE retrieves his spilled letters, a soldier passes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS466
01:08:15,00 --> 01:08:20,50
Now, flames dance inside a trash can. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS467
01:08:18,00 --> 01:08:27,50
SOMEONE tosses a stack of letters onto the fire. As he adds more from his box, his dark-haired buddy walks up. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS468
01:08:26,00 --> 01:08:35,50
Clenching his jaw, SOMEONE shakes his head, as he continues to toss letters into the flames. His friend eyes him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS470
01:08:43,00 --> 01:08:50,50
SOMEONE dumps the remainder of the box into the trash can. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS471
01:09:22,00 --> 01:09:27,50
He heads off, leaving SOMEONE staring at the fire. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS472
01:09:25,00 --> 01:09:32,50
Later, a convoy of military vehicles trundles down a dirt road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS473
01:09:29,00 --> 01:09:38,50
Dust churns from their wheels. A Humvee passes a man leading a camel and maneuvers unto a busier road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS474
01:09:35,00 --> 01:09:39,50
SOMEONE rides inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS475
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:09,50
A man runs in front of their Humvee with his arms raised over his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS476
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:17,50
The Humvee stops, and the soldiers climb out with their guns drawn. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS477
01:10:29,00 --> 01:10:33,50
SOMEONE heads away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS478
01:10:37,00 --> 01:10:45,50
SOMEONE's dark-haired friend joins him. With their guns at the ready, they creep around the parameter of a decrepit factory. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS479
01:10:44,00 --> 01:10:55,50
The captain gestures to the rest of the team. Meanwhile, SOMEONE and Noodles round the corner of a deteriorating cement wall. Noodles glances at SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS480
01:10:57,00 --> 01:11:05,50
A man on a balcony shoots Noodles. SOMEONE fires back, then talks into his radio. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS481
01:11:03,00 --> 01:11:12,50
He grabs Noodles by the vest and drags him out of harm’s way. Then inspects the soldier's chest. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS482
01:11:14,00 --> 01:11:19,50
SOMEONE extracts a bullet from Noodles' tactical vest. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS483
01:11:22,00 --> 01:11:28,50
As SOMEONE helps Noodles stand, four bullets rip through him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS484
01:11:26,00 --> 01:11:31,50
SOMEONE falls back in slow motion. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS485
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:35,50
Soldiers fire at his shooter, who collapses. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS486
01:11:35,00 --> 01:11:41,50
Kneeling beside SOMEONE, Noodles props him against a wall. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS487
01:11:44,00 --> 01:11:48,50
SOMEONE's vision blurs. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS488
01:11:49,00 --> 01:11:54,50
SOMEONE glances drowsily at Noodles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS489
01:11:54,00 --> 01:11:58,50
He gently slaps SOMEONE's cheek. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS490
01:11:59,00 --> 01:12:05,50
Our view of the soldiers tilts upside down, then drifts to the ground. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS492
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:12,50
Now pale light shines through Venetian blinds, as SOMEONE lies in a bed. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS493
01:12:09,00 --> 01:12:16,50
A hand adjusts the slats on the blinds and bright sunlight pours into the room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS494
01:12:14,00 --> 01:12:21,50
SOMEONE's head shifts, and his hazy vision finds a nurse at his bedside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS495
01:12:18,00 --> 01:12:23,50
She smiles down at the groggy soldier. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS496
01:12:29,00 --> 01:12:37,50
As helooks at the nurse's kind expression, SOMEONE's vision gets blurrier, and he closes his eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS497
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:38,50
Fade to black. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS498
01:12:39,00 --> 01:12:50,50
Now, SOMEONE sits on the side of his bed, with his arm in a sling. Struggling, he manages to lift the strap over his head. He drops the sling on the floor. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS499
01:12:49,00 --> 01:12:57,50
Eyeing his reflection in a mirror, he unsnaps the top of his hospital gown, to reveal his bandaged shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS500
01:12:54,00 --> 01:13:00,50
He winces as he tears the tape and gauze from his skin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS502
01:13:02,00 --> 01:13:11,50
As SOMEONE slips one arm into a t-shirt, sunlight gleams on the scarred flesh of two bullet wounds on his back. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS503
01:13:09,00 --> 01:13:19,50
Later, he straightens the collar of his army fatigues. Standing in front of the mirror in his uniform, he pulls his belt tight around his waist. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS504
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:24,50
Now, he enters a military building, and turns down a hallway. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS505
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:29,50
He finds the captain writing at a desk in his office. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS506
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:32,50
The captain looks up, as SOMEONE walks in. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS507
01:13:51,00 --> 01:13:55,50
SOMEONE doesn't budge. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS508
01:13:56,00 --> 01:14:02,50
He sullenly lowers himself into a chair, across from the captain. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS509
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:16,50
The captain grins. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS510
01:14:35,00 --> 01:14:39,50
SOMEONE holds the captain's gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS511
01:14:37,00 --> 01:14:42,50
Now, a helicopter sweeps over a desert. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS512
01:14:42,00 --> 01:14:48,50
Inside, SOMEONE shifts his gaze away from the open side door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS513
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:54,50
Now, a smoke grenade billows on an Afghan street, as soldier’s race across it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS514
01:14:52,00 --> 01:14:57,50
SOMEONE searches an abandon building, his gun drawn. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS515
01:14:56,00 --> 01:15:02,50
Outside of a village, three explosions burst from the ground. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS516
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:05,50
SOMEONE leads a group of soldiers down a rocky hill. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS517
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:10,50
He directs his team as they race away from a hut. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS518
01:15:09,00 --> 01:15:15,50
It explodes and flames shoot into the sky. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS519
01:15:12,00 --> 01:15:18,50
Now, words appear. Special forces base, Qatar. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS521
01:15:17,00 --> 01:15:22,50
SOMEONE strolls into his room, and reclines on his bed. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS522
01:15:25,00 --> 01:15:30,50
A soldier stops in the doorway. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS523
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:34,50
SOMEONE sits up with an alarmed look. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS524
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:39,50
He lowers his gaze from the soldier. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS525
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:44,50
Now, he stares out an airplane window. His eyes narrowing as sunlight rises across his face. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS526
01:15:42,00 --> 01:15:49,50
Later in a hospital hallway, SOMEONE watches his father through a window. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS527
01:15:46,00 --> 01:15:52,50
Tubes trail from Mr. SOMEONE's mouth to a nearby ventilator. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS528
01:15:50,00 --> 01:15:54,50
A doctor stops beside SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS529
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:22,50
SOMEONE bows his head slightly and nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS531
01:16:22,00 --> 01:16:30,50
Wearing his army uniform, and carrying two bags, SOMEONE mounts the steps to his dad's house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS532
01:16:28,00 --> 01:16:34,50
He sets one bag down, opens the screen door and heads inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS533
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:37,50
Dim light bathes his face as he steps into the kitchen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS534
01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:42,50
Dirty dishes, bottles, and jars clutter the counter top and stove. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS535
01:16:39,00 --> 01:16:45,50
SOMEONE's haunted stare holds steady on the mess. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS537
01:16:44,00 --> 01:16:52,50
He treads down a hall to his father's shadowy study, and lingers in the doorway. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS538
01:16:51,00 --> 01:16:59,50
Now, he pulls open a drawer and finds a jumble of dozens of coins in small boxes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS539
01:16:57,00 --> 01:17:02,50
He takes out a blue velvet box and opens it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS540
01:16:59,00 --> 01:17:06,50
With a sober stare, he turns over the Jefferson Mule in his fingers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS541
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:08,50
Seated at his father's desk. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS542
01:17:05,00 --> 01:17:11,50
He lifts his head and gazes out a window. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS543
01:17:10,00 --> 01:17:16,50
SOMEONE sets the coin aside, and takes out a blank sheet of paper. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS544
01:17:14,00 --> 01:17:22,50
He lays it on the desk, then takes a pen from a holder and writes the word, Dear in the upper left hand corner. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS545
01:17:20,00 --> 01:17:28,50
Now in the hospital, SOMEONE strides up to his father's room. But finds his bed empty. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS546
01:17:25,00 --> 01:17:30,50
He glances around, uneasily. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS547
01:17:31,00 --> 01:17:36,50
Doctors and nurses bustle past. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS548
01:17:33,00 --> 01:17:42,50
His brow furrowed, SOMEONE spots a cot in the corridor, and strides toward it to find his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS549
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:46,50
The ailing man wears an oxygen mask. An IV bag hangs above his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS550
01:17:51,00 --> 01:17:56,50
A doctor reading a file, continues on her way. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS551
01:17:57,00 --> 01:18:02,50
Mr. SOMEONE gives a weary blink. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS552
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:04,50
SOMEONE stares at him uncomfortably. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS553
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:08,50
He takes an envelope from his back pocket. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS555
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:18,50
Glides his finger along its edge, then reluctantly hands it to his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS556
01:18:15,00 --> 01:18:20,50
Mr. SOMEONE lifts the flap. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS559
01:18:23,00 --> 01:18:32,50
With palsied hands, Mr. SOMEONE closes the envelope’s flap, and tucks the letter against the side of his body. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS560
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:33,50
SOMEONE sways awkwardly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS561
01:18:37,00 --> 01:18:42,50
He scoots a wheeled stool over, and takes a seat. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS562
01:18:39,00 --> 01:18:46,50
As doctors and nurses stride past, he slides the letter out of the envelope. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS563
01:18:49,00 --> 01:18:54,50
His father watches through heavy lidded eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS564
01:19:41,00 --> 01:19:47,50
His ailing father offers a series of slow nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS565
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:33,50
Mr. SOMEONE gazes at his son tenderly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS566
01:20:30,00 --> 01:20:36,50
His right hand trembles against his chest. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS567
01:20:48,00 --> 01:20:55,50
SOMEONE's smoothly shaven jaw quivers as his eyes remain locked on his letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS568
01:20:52,00 --> 01:20:57,50
He resolutely shakes his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS569
01:21:02,00 --> 01:21:09,50
His father limply raises one hand and rests it against SOMEONE's shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS570
01:21:06,00 --> 01:21:14,50
As it slides off, SOMEONE catches it, and lovingly touches his chin to his father's frail fingers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS571
01:21:17,00 --> 01:21:24,50
Mr. SOMEONE pulls his hand away and places his palm against SOMEONE's cheek. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS572
01:21:21,00 --> 01:21:26,50
SOMEONE holds it in place with his own hand. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS573
01:21:25,00 --> 01:21:31,50
Sliding his father's hand to cup the back of his neck. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS574
01:21:28,00 --> 01:21:35,50
SOMEONE hunches down and hides his face in the crook of the man's frail arm. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS575
01:21:32,00 --> 01:21:38,50
Mr. SOMEONE raises his other hand to his son. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS576
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:42,50
The soldier lifts his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS577
01:21:39,00 --> 01:21:44,50
And his father strokes his short hair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS578
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:50,50
SOMEONE gently collapses unto the man's chest. And the coin collector cradles him as best he can. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS579
01:21:49,00 --> 01:21:55,50
Now, as misty rain pours down on an otherwise empty beach. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS580
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:59,50
SOMEONE sits beside his surfboard with his knees pulled up, and his head bowed. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS582
01:21:59,00 --> 01:22:06,50
Later, lying belly down on his surfboard, he paddles out in the steel gray sea. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS583
01:22:04,00 --> 01:22:10,50
Cloudy rain sheets down, as the waves buck and toss beneath him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS584
01:22:08,00 --> 01:22:15,50
He swings his legs into the water, and drops his unhooked ankle leash onto his board. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS585
01:22:13,00 --> 01:22:17,50
Releasing his grip on the board. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS586
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:19,50
He lets himself drift away from it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS587
01:22:17,00 --> 01:22:21,50
As he floats on his back, 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS588
01:22:18,00 --> 01:22:23,50
a foamy wave breaks nearby. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS589
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:26,50
Water laps at his face, and flows over his mouth. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS590
01:22:24,00 --> 01:22:32,50
His head sinks beneath the surface and he vanishes. His board gently bobs on the waves. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS591
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:37,50
A few feet under water, SOMEONE hovers vertically. His arms raised limply over his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS592
01:22:34,00 --> 01:22:40,50
Bubbles stream out of his mouth, as he tips his head back. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS593
01:22:38,00 --> 01:22:49,50
Later, still submerged, the grieving son buries his face in his hands. Then runs his fingers back into his hair, and covers his eyes with his palms. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS595
01:22:48,00 --> 01:22:55,50
SOMEONE sits alone in a vacant church. A coffin stands in front of the alter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS596
01:22:52,00 --> 01:22:56,50
A pastor creeps in. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS597
01:23:02,00 --> 01:23:07,50
The pastor nods, sympathetically. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS598
01:23:04,00 --> 01:23:10,50
Then glances at the coffin and paces out. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS599
01:23:07,00 --> 01:23:14,50
Wearing his dress uniform, SOMEONE stares off beneath his knitted brow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS600
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:17,50
His gaze shifts and he blinks sadly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS601
01:23:15,00 --> 01:23:22,50
The pastor disappears through a doorway, leaving SOMEONE alone once again. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS602
01:23:19,00 --> 01:23:26,50
Now, the soldier drives his car with a stoic frown. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS603
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:29,50
The images of passing trees reflect faintly on his windshield. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS604
01:23:27,00 --> 01:23:36,50
The car pulls through the gate of SOMEONE's family home. And follows the winding drive around a knarled tree. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS605
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:40,50
Slowing, the car pulls up alongside the corral beside the modest stables. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS606
01:23:38,00 --> 01:23:45,50
Inside, SOMEONE's slender long-legged silhouette stands, petting a horse. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS607
01:23:42,00 --> 01:23:48,50
SOMEONE stops the car and takes out his keys. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS608
01:23:45,00 --> 01:23:51,50
Her features lost in shadows, SOMEONE looks toward him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS609
01:23:48,00 --> 01:23:55,50
SOMEONE gets out and faces the stables. Nervously pursing his lips. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS610
01:23:52,00 --> 01:23:57,50
SOMEONE quickly locks the horse into its stall. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS611
01:23:58,00 --> 01:24:06,50
Her form still silhouetted against the stables rear open doorway. SOMEONE treads towards SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS612
01:24:03,00 --> 01:24:08,50
He moves across the corral. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS613
01:24:05,00 --> 01:24:12,50
His mouth twitches uneasily above his neatly pressed uniform shirt. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS614
01:24:09,00 --> 01:24:17,50
The shadows hiding SOMEONE's face fade, as she steps outside into the gentle sunlight. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS615
01:24:14,00 --> 01:24:20,50
It bathes her doe-like eyes and rosy cheeks. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS616
01:24:17,00 --> 01:24:22,50
SOMEONE moves faster. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS617
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:26,50
A pain smile fades from his former lover's rosebud lips. She halts. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS618
01:24:24,00 --> 01:24:30,50
SOMEONE continues toward her, then stops a few yards away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS619
01:24:27,00 --> 01:24:37,50
SOMEONE's corn silk hair lies captured in a tight braid, and she wears slim-fitting breaches and riding boots. She allows a smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS620
01:24:39,00 --> 01:24:46,50
A brief grin flickers over the corner of his mouth, as he stares at SOMEONE intensely. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS621
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:49,50
Gazing back at him, she summons a deep breath. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS622
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:54,50
SOMEONE uncomfortably shoves a hand into his pocket. His lips parting sadly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS623
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:12,50
SOMEONE swallows, dropping his gaze, then shakes his head and locks eyes with SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS624
01:25:10,00 --> 01:25:14,50
Her jaw drops. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS625
01:25:13,00 --> 01:25:18,50
She clutches both hands to her mouth and arches her brow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS626
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:39,50
She studies SOMEONE sympathetically. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS627
01:25:36,00 --> 01:25:42,50
He bows his head and shifts awkwardly from foot to foot. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS628
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:52,50
He reads a sign above the barn door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS629
01:26:07,00 --> 01:26:12,50
She forces a smile and gives a high shrug. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS630
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:19,50
SOMEONE lowers his stare and swallows. Swaying on his feet. Then looks back up at her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS631
01:26:16,00 --> 01:26:22,50
She tearfully meets his gaze before glancing away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS632
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:30,50
SOMEONE offers a faint nod. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS633
01:26:27,00 --> 01:26:32,50
Later in SOMEONE's dining room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS634
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:41,50
SOMEONE nods, then sorrowfully shakes her head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS635
01:26:38,00 --> 01:26:43,50
SOMEONE stares down at the table. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS636
01:26:54,00 --> 01:26:59,50
Smiling, SOMEONE drops his gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS637
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:05,50
SOMEONE offers a candid grin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS638
01:27:02,00 --> 01:27:06,50
SOMEONE nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS639
01:27:07,00 --> 01:27:12,50
She hurries away, and he idly looks around. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS640
01:27:17,00 --> 01:27:23,50
The soldier gets up and ambles towards a mantle. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS641
01:27:20,00 --> 01:27:25,50
Where several framed photographs stand. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS642
01:27:22,00 --> 01:27:27,50
SOMEONE glances at him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS643
01:27:28,00 --> 01:27:32,50
She presses her lips together. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS644
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:38,50
One photograph shows SOMEONE in a wedding dress. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS645
01:27:37,00 --> 01:27:42,50
She poses with SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS646
01:27:45,00 --> 01:27:51,50
SOMEONE stares at the wedding photo. His brow knit. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS647
01:27:48,00 --> 01:27:53,50
SOMEONE summons a breath and eyes him uneasily. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS648
01:27:56,00 --> 01:28:01,50
SOMEONE swallows hard. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS649
01:28:01,00 --> 01:28:07,50
In the photo, SOMEONE beams beside her bearded groom. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS650
01:28:04,00 --> 01:28:10,50
Later, SOMEONE and SOMEONE stroll through a sunny park. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS651
01:28:27,00 --> 01:28:32,50
Later in a hospital, they head into an atrium. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS652
01:28:36,00 --> 01:28:42,50
They find a beardless SOMEONE sitting in a wheelchair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS653
01:28:39,00 --> 01:28:43,50
He musters a smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS654
01:28:40,00 --> 01:28:45,50
A teenage SOMEONE jogs up. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS655
01:28:51,00 --> 01:28:55,50
SOMEONE faces her husband. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS656
01:28:54,00 --> 01:28:58,50
She kisses him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS657
01:29:04,00 --> 01:29:08,50
SOMEONE skips off after SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS658
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:12,50
SOMEONE stands awkwardly in front of the cancer patient. Clasping his hands. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS659
01:29:15,00 --> 01:29:21,50
SOMEONE takes a seat and the ailing father studies him wryly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS660
01:29:25,00 --> 01:29:29,50
Nodding, the two men lock gazes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS661
01:29:27,00 --> 01:29:31,50
SOMEONE earnestly lifts his brow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS662
01:29:30,00 --> 01:29:34,50
SOMEONE drops his eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS663
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:48,50
SOMEONE gives a long weary blink. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS664
01:30:05,00 --> 01:30:11,50
The soldier's gaze drifts thoughtfully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS665
01:30:10,00 --> 01:30:15,50
SOMEONE stares off. His eyes bleary. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS666
01:30:13,00 --> 01:30:19,50
SOMEONE tucks his lips into his mouth and bites them gently. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS667
01:30:16,00 --> 01:30:23,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE as she stands with SOMEONE at a snack kiosk. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS668
01:30:30,00 --> 01:30:35,50
SOMEONE bows his head, avoiding SOMEONE's gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS669
01:30:38,00 --> 01:30:44,50
The patient's lips twitch into a wincing smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS670
01:30:41,00 --> 01:30:46,50
SOMEONE's eyes remain downcast. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS671
01:30:44,00 --> 01:30:50,50
He lifts his head and glances at SOMEONE, blinking pensively. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS672
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:55,50
Later, SOMEONE's SUV parks in front of her plantation style home. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS673
01:30:52,00 --> 01:30:57,50
SOMEONE gets out and races away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS674
01:30:57,00 --> 01:31:04,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE linger in the vehicle. Their seat-belts fastened. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS675
01:31:05,00 --> 01:31:09,50
SOMEONE unbuckles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS676
01:31:06,00 --> 01:31:11,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS677
01:31:44,00 --> 01:31:49,50
Staring off despondently. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS678
01:31:46,00 --> 01:31:53,50
SOMEONE tightens her rosebud lips, then locks eyes with her former lover. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS679
01:31:55,00 --> 01:32:00,50
SOMEONE manages a smile and looks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS681
01:31:58,00 --> 01:32:04,50
In a dining room, SOMEONE pours herself a glass of wine. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS682
01:32:01,00 --> 01:32:05,50
SOMEONE glowers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS683
01:32:10,00 --> 01:32:14,50
She uncomfortably shifts her gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS684
01:32:12,00 --> 01:32:19,50
As SOMEONE studies her inscrutably out of the corner of his eye, she rubs her lips together. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS685
01:32:32,00 --> 01:32:38,50
Her wounded smile fades, and she looks to the ceiling. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS686
01:32:40,00 --> 01:32:46,50
SOMEONE taps his fork against his plate and sets it down. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS687
01:32:52,00 --> 01:32:58,50
SOMEONE stares with doe-like eyes, then lowers her dark lashes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS688
01:33:04,00 --> 01:33:09,50
SOMEONE glares, shifting his jaw. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS689
01:33:06,00 --> 01:33:10,50
His mouth opens as if to speak. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS690
01:33:08,00 --> 01:33:12,50
But he shuts it and looks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS691
01:33:09,00 --> 01:33:13,50
He shakes his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS692
01:33:12,00 --> 01:33:17,50
His intense gaze grows tearful. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS693
01:33:37,00 --> 01:33:41,50
SOMEONE hangs her head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS694
01:33:39,00 --> 01:33:43,50
Bobbing it equivocatingly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS695
01:33:40,00 --> 01:33:44,50
She stares at the table. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS696
01:33:53,00 --> 01:33:57,50
She looks up imploringly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS697
01:34:02,00 --> 01:34:06,50
SOMEONE gapes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS698
01:34:03,00 --> 01:34:10,50
SOMEONE rises and starts out of the room, then whirls around. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS699
01:34:54,00 --> 01:34:59,50
SOMEONE pulls her into his arms. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS700
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:01,50
She buries her face against his chest. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS701
01:35:03,00 --> 01:35:09,50
Cupping SOMEONE's head in his hand, he gently rocks her back and forth. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS702
01:35:07,00 --> 01:35:11,50
Later in the sitting room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS703
01:35:08,00 --> 01:35:14,50
She removes a rubber band from a stack of SOMEONE's letters. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS704
01:35:11,00 --> 01:35:15,50
He takes an envelope. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS705
01:35:21,00 --> 01:35:26,50
SOMEONE slides out the letter inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS706
01:35:33,00 --> 01:35:38,50
It reads, I love you, SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS707
01:35:36,00 --> 01:35:43,50
As she reaches for the stack of letters, she knocks over a glass of wine. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS708
01:35:44,00 --> 01:35:49,50
Liquid drips from SOMEONE's sleeve. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS709
01:35:50,00 --> 01:35:56,50
SOMEONE unbuttons his wet sleeve as he heads into a bathroom. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS710
01:35:57,00 --> 01:36:04,50
Behind him, SOMEONE stands just inside a bedroom with a door half open. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS711
01:36:01,00 --> 01:36:05,50
She removes her blouse. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS712
01:36:02,00 --> 01:36:10,50
As SOMEONE scrubs his sleeve, he glimpses a reflection of her bare back in the bathroom mirror. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS713
01:36:07,00 --> 01:36:12,50
He eyes her longingly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS714
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:16,50
SOMEONE brushes her hair back and turns, catching SOMEONE's gaze in the mirror. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS715
01:36:13,00 --> 01:36:18,50
The former lovers lock eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS716
01:36:15,00 --> 01:36:23,50
SOMEONE turns away pulls a flannel shirt over her shoulders. SOMEONE bows his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS717
01:36:20,00 --> 01:36:25,50
Now they head downstairs. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS718
01:36:26,00 --> 01:36:32,50
She heads into the kitchen, but SOMEONE strides past the doorway. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS719
01:36:29,00 --> 01:36:36,50
She glances back at him, then leans heavily on a counter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS720
01:36:33,00 --> 01:36:40,50
In the hall, SOMEONE shifts his weight uneasily, then treads toward the kitchen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS721
01:36:37,00 --> 01:36:46,50
As SOMEONE turns to face him, he halts in the doorway and stares at her resolutely. One hand shoved in his pocket. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS722
01:36:44,00 --> 01:36:49,50
She tearfully locks eyes with him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS723
01:36:49,00 --> 01:36:53,50
Clenching his jaw. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS724
01:36:50,00 --> 01:36:57,50
He holds SOMEONE's gaze. Then turns from the doorway and strides off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS725
01:36:55,00 --> 01:37:02,50
He walks into the dining room, and retrieves his jacket from the back of his chair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS726
01:37:00,00 --> 01:37:06,50
SOMEONE joins him, her dark-lashed eyes blinking forlornly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS727
01:37:06,00 --> 01:37:11,50
She looks to SOMEONE, then shyly shifts her gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS728
01:37:09,00 --> 01:37:14,50
He grinds his jaw as he watches her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS729
01:37:11,00 --> 01:37:15,50
She beams at him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS730
01:37:14,00 --> 01:37:18,50
SOMEONE looks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS731
01:37:22,00 --> 01:37:27,50
His gaze downcast, he backs away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS732
01:37:24,00 --> 01:37:29,50
Then heads to the front door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS733
01:37:28,00 --> 01:37:31,50
He halts. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS734
01:37:29,00 --> 01:37:33,50
SOMEONE stares at the floor. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS735
01:37:33,00 --> 01:37:39,50
She takes a few steps toward him and raises her tearful eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS736
01:37:36,00 --> 01:37:44,50
As SOMEONE turns, she lifts her brow expectantly and offers a faint smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS737
01:37:41,00 --> 01:37:46,50
He meets her pleading stare, then bows his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS739
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:51,50
He opens the screen door and steps outside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS740
01:37:49,00 --> 01:37:55,50
SOMEONE swallows, cringing as tears well in her eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS741
01:37:52,00 --> 01:37:57,50
She shakes her head disbelievingly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS742
01:37:55,00 --> 01:38:02,50
Outside, SOMEONE trudges to his car. His jacket slung over his shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS743
01:37:59,00 --> 01:38:05,50
Inside, tears stream down SOMEONE's face. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS745
01:38:07,00 --> 01:38:12,50
SOMEONE's car trundles down the driveway. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS746
01:38:10,00 --> 01:38:15,50
Inside, SOMEONE rests his head against his hand. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS747
01:38:13,00 --> 01:38:17,50
Tears shine on his face. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS748
01:38:17,00 --> 01:38:22,50
His face seizes. His chin trembling. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS749
01:38:19,00 --> 01:38:25,50
He rubs his brow, then pounds his hand on the steering wheel. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS751
01:38:25,00 --> 01:38:32,50
He accidentally turns on his wipers and they glide across the windshield. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS752
01:38:29,00 --> 01:38:33,50
He flips them off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS753
01:38:31,00 --> 01:38:38,50
Later at his house, he stands in his father's study with his hands in his pockets. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS754
01:38:35,00 --> 01:38:43,50
He thoughtfully eyes the boxes of coins stored under a glass counter. Then pulls them out. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS755
01:38:41,00 --> 01:38:46,50
Now at the Honest Coin dealer shop. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS756
01:39:13,00 --> 01:39:19,50
Outside, SOMEONE opens his trunk to reveal the collection. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS757
01:39:33,00 --> 01:39:40,50
Now in a desert, SOMEONE holds out his Jefferson Mule. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS758
01:39:42,00 --> 01:39:48,50
SOMEONE flips the coin into the sand. The soldier inspects it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS759
01:39:49,00 --> 01:39:54,50
As SOMEONE leads the group, a soldier approaches him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS760
01:39:53,00 --> 01:39:57,50
He hands over an envelope. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS761
01:39:56,00 --> 01:40:00,50
SOMEONE studies the envelope. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS762
01:39:57,00 --> 01:40:04,50
Later, soldiers load cargo into vehicles as SOMEONE reads his letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS763
01:40:30,00 --> 01:40:36,50
In a flashback, guests greet SOMEONE at a casual party. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS764
01:40:34,00 --> 01:40:39,50
He laughs with SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS765
01:40:42,00 --> 01:40:48,50
In another flashback, SOMEONE writes the letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS766
01:40:57,00 --> 01:41:04,50
Nighttime, SOMEONE stands on her porch and gazes into the sky. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS767
01:41:08,00 --> 01:41:14,50
Tears glisten in her eyes as she stares at the moon. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS768
01:41:18,00 --> 01:41:24,50
Now, SOMEONE wheels a bike down a busy street. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS769
01:41:23,00 --> 01:41:29,50
He wears a button down shirt and a neatly trimmed goatee. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS770
01:41:26,00 --> 01:41:33,50
A view through a cafe window shows SOMEONE seated at a table by herself. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS771
01:41:31,00 --> 01:41:38,50
SOMEONE's reflection appears on an adjoining window, as he bends to lock his bike to a parking meter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS772
01:41:36,00 --> 01:41:41,50
Inside, SOMEONE notices SOMEONE. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS773
01:41:38,00 --> 01:41:43,50
Noticing her, he does a double take, 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS774
01:41:40,00 --> 01:41:44,50
and they share a smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS775
01:41:46,00 --> 01:41:51,50
SOMEONE rises and heads outside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS776
01:41:49,00 --> 01:41:54,50
Grinning, she wraps her arms around SOMEONE's neck. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS777
01:41:51,00 --> 01:41:56,50
And blissfully closes her eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS778
01:41:53,00 --> 01:41:59,50
SOMEONE holds her tightly. His face buried against her shoulder. 

EASY_A_DVS13
00:02:57,00 --> 00:03:01,50
The teacher catches a boy with a joint. 

EASY_A_DVS14
00:04:02,00 --> 00:04:07,50
He offers a bong. 

EASY_A_DVS15
00:04:07,00 --> 00:04:12,50
She reaches for it, letting her breasts hang out. 

EASY_A_DVS16
00:04:34,00 --> 00:04:45,50
Friday afternoon, SOMEONE opens a greeting card that reads, "To my granddaughter, you're my pocket full of sunshine." She finds a $5 SOMEONE inside. 

EASY_A_DVS17
00:04:46,00 --> 00:04:51,50
Saturday morning, SOMEONE opens the card again. 

EASY_A_DVS18

Painting her toenails, she sings to a dog on her bed, then paints the dog's nails. 

EASY_A_DVS19
00:04:56,00 --> 00:05:00,50
Saturday afternoon. 

EASY_A_DVS20
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:09,50
Saturday night, SOMEONE kneels before her dog, shaking her hips. Sunday morning, SOMEONE repeatedly opens and shuts the card. 

EASY_A_DVS21
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:15,50
Sunday afternoon, in the shower. 

EASY_A_DVS23
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:34,50
She glances about, then shuts the card and joins the dog on her bed. 

EASY_A_DVS24
00:06:12,00 --> 00:06:16,50
In the ladies room. 

EASY_A_DVS25
00:07:09,00 --> 00:07:16,50
Another girl steps out of a stall and glares at SOMEONE, while washing her hands. 

EASY_A_DVS26
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:25,50
She flicks water at SOMEONE, and leaves. 

EASY_A_DVS27
00:07:32,00 --> 00:07:37,50
SOMEONE passes out flyers. 

EASY_A_DVS28
00:07:38,00 --> 00:07:41,50
Last year. 

EASY_A_DVS29
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:56,50
A guy in a devil costume tears through a banner, his face and bare chest painted blue. Launching off a trampoline, he flips and dunks a basketball then hangs from the hoop. He throws his toy pitchfork into the crowd. 

EASY_A_DVS31
00:08:05,00 --> 00:08:08,50
This year. 

EASY_A_DVS32
00:08:08,00 --> 00:08:17,50
A plush Woodchuck mascot rips through a banner with a wheelbarrow of logs. He pretends to gnaw on one. 

EASY_A_DVS33
00:08:23,00 --> 00:08:29,50
He launches off the trampoline for a dunk, but falls on his face. 

EASY_A_DVS34
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:37,50
He shows a title. 

EASY_A_DVS35
00:08:50,00 --> 00:09:04,50
Our view dashes across the school grounds to a guy on a cellphone. We zip into a classroom where a few students read a text message. In a theater class, a guy checks his phone while lying on stage mid rehearsal. 

EASY_A_DVS36
00:09:02,00 --> 00:09:12,50
We zoom out the window, then zip around the building into another class. Where a girl turns to show a text to a friend at a desk behind her. 

EASY_A_DVS37
00:09:11,00 --> 00:09:22,50
The friend turns to a guy behind her, then we shoot outside past a row of lockers to find SOMEONE. The red-haired teen stands alone. Listening to the chatter. 

EASY_A_DVS38
00:09:22,00 --> 00:09:28,50
Turning to go, she runs into SOMEONE with a snooty friend. 

EASY_A_DVS39
00:09:39,00 --> 00:09:45,50
They pat their hearts and raise their hands to the sky. 

EASY_A_DVS40
00:10:24,00 --> 00:10:29,50
She rejoins SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS41
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:54,50
Now at home. 

EASY_A_DVS42
00:11:59,00 --> 00:12:04,50
A black boy sits beside her. 

EASY_A_DVS43
00:13:09,00 --> 00:13:14,50
At school her peers stare. 

EASY_A_DVS44
00:15:08,00 --> 00:15:13,50
SOMEONE's hand shoots up. 

EASY_A_DVS45
00:15:21,00 --> 00:15:25,50
She faces SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS46
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:45,50
Now SOMEONE glares at SOMEONE, from behind an administrative counter, while aggressively stapling a document. 

EASY_A_DVS47
00:16:04,00 --> 00:16:09,50
SOMEONE pounds on the stapler. 

EASY_A_DVS48
00:16:12,00 --> 00:16:20,50
An athletic team steps into view, followed by a smaller guy holding a rag to his bloody nose. 

EASY_A_DVS49
00:16:19,00 --> 00:16:24,50
Now in the principal's office. 

EASY_A_DVS50
00:17:19,00 --> 00:17:23,50
He scribbles on a slip. 

EASY_A_DVS51
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:35,50
He points at the door. 

EASY_A_DVS52
00:17:42,00 --> 00:17:49,50
Outside Woodchuck SOMEONE carries the head of his costume as he falls into step with SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS53
00:18:12,00 --> 00:18:16,50
He high fives a guy. 

EASY_A_DVS54
00:18:16,00 --> 00:18:20,50
SOMEONE joins SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS55
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:54,50
SOMEONE mimics a boxer. 

EASY_A_DVS56
00:18:57,00 --> 00:19:05,50
She musses her friend's hair and saunters off. Now at home, SOMEONE's mother serves her peas. 

EASY_A_DVS57
00:19:21,00 --> 00:19:26,50
SOMEONE eyes her younger brother. 

EASY_A_DVS59
00:20:18,00 --> 00:20:23,50
Her brother eyes her plate. 

EASY_A_DVS60
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:06,50
She kisses her mom. 

EASY_A_DVS61
00:21:11,00 --> 00:21:15,50
Her husband sits with their son. 

EASY_A_DVS62
00:21:14,00 --> 00:21:19,50
Now SOMEONE mops the gym. 

EASY_A_DVS63
00:22:02,00 --> 00:22:08,50
She grins at him. Now they clean a tennis court. 

EASY_A_DVS64
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:28,50
Later, SOMEONE wipes graffiti from a bathroom stall. 

EASY_A_DVS65
00:22:27,00 --> 00:22:31,50
SOMEONE adds graffiti. 

EASY_A_DVS66
00:23:38,00 --> 00:23:43,50
Now on a ridge overlooking the town. 

EASY_A_DVS67
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:30,50
Lounging on the hood of an old VW bug, SOMEONE reaches through the window and takes out her cellphone. 

EASY_A_DVS68
00:24:54,00 --> 00:24:58,50
SOMEONE nods. 

EASY_A_DVS69
00:25:15,00 --> 00:25:20,50
We peer through an arched hedge. 

EASY_A_DVS70
00:25:18,00 --> 00:25:31,50
SOMEONE rides into view on a scooter, lurches to a halt and dismounts awkwardly. He arrives at the Penderghast front door and knocks. SOMEONE's mother answers with a warm delighted smile. 

EASY_A_DVS71
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:43,50
She pulls him inside. 

EASY_A_DVS72
00:25:42,00 --> 00:25:46,50
She faces a stairway. 

EASY_A_DVS73
00:25:58,00 --> 00:26:03,50
She leads SOMEONE upstairs. 

EASY_A_DVS74
00:27:20,00 --> 00:27:27,50
Under her puzzled stare, SOMEONE screws up his mouth and nods coolly. 

EASY_A_DVS75
00:28:38,00 --> 00:28:43,50
His eyes well with tears. 

EASY_A_DVS76
00:28:40,00 --> 00:28:45,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

EASY_A_DVS77
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:48,50
SOMEONE stares imploringly at her. 

EASY_A_DVS78
00:29:17,00 --> 00:29:23,50
At the party, two teens water slide into a pool. 

EASY_A_DVS79
00:29:56,00 --> 00:30:00,50
She leans close to Melody. 

EASY_A_DVS80
00:30:22,00 --> 00:30:27,50
She pretends to munch on his ear. 

EASY_A_DVS81
00:30:38,00 --> 00:30:42,50
She shuts the door. 

EASY_A_DVS82
00:30:40,00 --> 00:30:46,50
She slips off a pair of red SOMEONE panties from under her skirt. 

EASY_A_DVS83
00:30:53,00 --> 00:30:58,50
She hangs them on the doorknob, blocking the keyhole. 

EASY_A_DVS84
00:30:55,00 --> 00:31:02,50
The bully tries to peer through, as a crowd gathers. SOMEONE eyes the drapes. 

EASY_A_DVS85
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:10,50
He goes to the bed. 

EASY_A_DVS86
00:31:21,00 --> 00:31:26,50
The eavesdropping team swap looks. 

EASY_A_DVS87
00:31:29,00 --> 00:31:35,50
She slaps him, then cups a hand over his mouth. 

EASY_A_DVS88
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:54,50
She spanks him with a book. 

EASY_A_DVS89
00:32:01,00 --> 00:32:06,50
He yanks him to his feet. 

EASY_A_DVS90
00:32:07,00 --> 00:32:12,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE jump on the bed and smack the wall. 

EASY_A_DVS91
00:32:25,00 --> 00:32:30,50
He slaps her rear end and she smacks him. 

EASY_A_DVS92
00:32:57,00 --> 00:33:01,50
She punches him in the gut. 

EASY_A_DVS93
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:11,50
SOMEONE hops down off the bed as SOMEONE recovers. 

EASY_A_DVS94
00:33:11,00 --> 00:33:16,50
As he stands, she musses his hair and rumbles his shirt. 

EASY_A_DVS95
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:22,50
Pausing, SOMEONE grabs her arm. 

EASY_A_DVS96
00:33:20,00 --> 00:33:25,50
Olives meets his earnest gaze. 

EASY_A_DVS97
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:29,50
As she smiles and nods, he leans his forehead against hers. 

EASY_A_DVS98
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:35,50
SOMEONE beams kindly, and gives another nod. Facing the door, SOMEONE halts. 

EASY_A_DVS99
00:33:34,00 --> 00:33:40,50
He hands her the panties. SOMEONE salutes him, then stuffs them in his pocket. 

EASY_A_DVS100
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:47,50
The eavesdroppers scatter as SOMEONE opens the door. 

EASY_A_DVS101
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:51,50
He heads into the hallway. 

EASY_A_DVS102
00:33:51,00 --> 00:33:56,50
His bully accosts him. 

EASY_A_DVS103
00:34:06,00 --> 00:34:20,50
The bully gives him a friendly shove into a crowd of congratulatory males. As SOMEONE makes her way through the hallway, other teens clear a path and stare at her. She nearly bumps into SOMEONE at a doorway. 

EASY_A_DVS104
00:34:43,00 --> 00:34:49,50
Behind her back, several guys crudely thrust their pelvises. 

EASY_A_DVS105
00:34:47,00 --> 00:34:52,50
As she turns around, they sheepishly stop. 

EASY_A_DVS106
00:35:18,00 --> 00:35:23,50
Now SOMEONE plays an acoustic guitar in her room. 

EASY_A_DVS107
00:35:22,00 --> 00:35:28,50
Her mother enters, bearing a green box wrapped with a blue ribbon. 

EASY_A_DVS108
00:36:26,00 --> 00:36:31,50
Her mother bumps and grinds her hips on her way out. 

EASY_A_DVS109
00:36:37,00 --> 00:36:45,50
SOMEONE bonds unto her bed and opens the box. Inside she finds a greeting card with a gift card. 

EASY_A_DVS110
00:36:47,00 --> 00:36:53,50
She pulls out a phallic object wrapped in tissue. 

EASY_A_DVS111
00:36:52,00 --> 00:36:58,50
SOMEONE sets it back in the box, and answers her cell. 

EASY_A_DVS112
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:09,50
The box vibrates. 

EASY_A_DVS113
00:38:01,00 --> 00:38:05,50
She ends the call. 

EASY_A_DVS114
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:14,50
She flings all the clothes out of her closet and storms out. 

EASY_A_DVS115
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:27,50
Later, she returns toting a half dozen shopping bags. Now SOMEONE tears red fabric into scraps then meticulously cuts them up with scissors as her dog looks on. 

EASY_A_DVS116
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:32,50
Pulling bustiers from the shopping bags, she sits to work with a needle and thread. 

EASY_A_DVS117
00:38:30,00 --> 00:38:34,50
She pricks herself. 

EASY_A_DVS118
00:38:32,00 --> 00:38:38,50
She sucks her thumb, but keeps working, cutting the thread with her teeth. 

EASY_A_DVS119
00:38:36,00 --> 00:38:40,50
Her father steps in. 

EASY_A_DVS121
00:39:07,00 --> 00:39:17,50
They share a grin, and he heads out. Later SOMEONE sews with a smile. She bites off the thread then studies her handiwork. 

EASY_A_DVS123
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:38,50
In an outdoor breezeway, SOMEONE struts into a crowd of students wearing a black bustier with a red letter A sewn to the bust. A double strand of pearls rings her neck, and her auburn hair falls in soft curls around her face. Dark sunglasses hide her eyes above her coy smile. As she sashays onward, the students stare at her. 

EASY_A_DVS124
00:39:36,00 --> 00:39:40,50
She makes a kissy face. 

EASY_A_DVS125
00:39:37,00 --> 00:39:44,50
A girl and guy watched slack-jawed. SOMEONE smirks to herself. 

EASY_A_DVS126
00:39:41,00 --> 00:39:52,50
With a bustier showing off her narrow waist, she halts facing SOMEONE and SOMEONE. The blonde eyes her friend scandalous outfit, and shakes her head. 

EASY_A_DVS127
00:40:04,00 --> 00:40:09,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

EASY_A_DVS128
00:40:24,00 --> 00:40:28,50
SOMEONE smacks SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS129
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:38,50
Now at the lunch counter, SOMEONE serves herself mashed potatoes. Two guys ogle her. She eats some of her potatoes, and sucks the spoon. 

EASY_A_DVS130
00:40:37,00 --> 00:40:46,50
One guy drops his tray. As they scramble away, SOMEONE finds herself facing SOMEONE, who snares and heads off. 

EASY_A_DVS131
00:40:43,00 --> 00:40:50,50
Seeing Mr. SOMEONE behind her, SOMEONE yanks the spoon from her mouth. 

EASY_A_DVS132
00:40:57,00 --> 00:41:01,50
Now in a gazebo. 

EASY_A_DVS133
00:41:59,00 --> 00:42:03,50
She points at everyone. 

EASY_A_DVS134
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:13,50
A hunky guy with a cross necklace accompanies a boy on guitar. 

EASY_A_DVS135
00:42:42,00 --> 00:42:47,50
SOMEONE climbs out of a lap pool. 

EASY_A_DVS136
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:11,50
He gives her a playful shove. A chubby guy drives off behind her. 

EASY_A_DVS137
00:43:38,00 --> 00:43:43,50
She stutters and stalks off. 

EASY_A_DVS138
00:43:42,00 --> 00:43:48,50
She gives him an angry gape. SOMEONE blinks shamefully. 

EASY_A_DVS139
00:43:57,00 --> 00:44:02,50
He gestures at his chunky build. 

EASY_A_DVS140
00:44:03,00 --> 00:44:07,50
He plods away. 

EASY_A_DVS141
00:44:04,00 --> 00:44:09,50
SOMEONE lingers, brushing her hair back. 

EASY_A_DVS142
00:44:06,00 --> 00:44:12,50
She watches as SOMEONE plops down on a bench. 

EASY_A_DVS143
00:44:18,00 --> 00:44:24,50
He glumly eats a snack. SOMEONE bombs her head equivocatingly. 

EASY_A_DVS144
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:25,50
His hopeful expression fades as she saunters off. 

EASY_A_DVS145
00:45:33,00 --> 00:45:41,50
Our view zooms from guys texting at the pool, to more guys huddle around a cellphone on the soccer field. 

EASY_A_DVS146
00:45:38,00 --> 00:45:48,50
Nearby, a girl talks to a football player. She heads to the track, where four other girls race, then stop and huddle around a phone. 

EASY_A_DVS147
00:45:47,00 --> 00:45:53,50
Our view whizzes to the bleachers, where another girl chats with a couple. 

EASY_A_DVS148
00:45:52,00 --> 00:46:08,50
We zoom through tennis courts, through a locker room, and into the gym. A dance team reads a text, as they rehearse a can-can. We whiz back through the locker room, to the lap pool, where SOMEONE stands uncomfortably. A guy points at her. 

EASY_A_DVS149
00:46:27,00 --> 00:46:31,50
A Christian boy play guitar. 

EASY_A_DVS150
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:49,50
Paris Bueller sings. 

EASY_A_DVS151
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:12,50
SOMEONE shows another page to her webcam. 

EASY_A_DVS152
00:48:14,00 --> 00:48:19,50
Now she knocks on Mr. SOMEONE's open door. 

EASY_A_DVS153
00:48:21,00 --> 00:48:26,50
She takes a seat facing his desk. 

EASY_A_DVS154
00:48:23,00 --> 00:48:30,50
He nods, then waggles a finger at a scarlet A on her pink bustier. 

EASY_A_DVS155
00:50:17,00 --> 00:50:22,50
A tall blonde enters. 

EASY_A_DVS156
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:29,50
SOMEONE leaves. 

EASY_A_DVS157
00:50:38,00 --> 00:50:43,50
As they kiss, he gropes her rear. 

EASY_A_DVS158
00:51:24,00 --> 00:51:29,50
He pinches her butt. 

EASY_A_DVS159
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:47,50
He stares longingly after his wife, then frowns and shifts his gaze. Now in the administrative office, SOMEONE sharpens pencils and blows off the shavings. 

EASY_A_DVS160
00:51:59,00 --> 00:52:05,50
SOMEONE scowls at SOMEONE, who winks back at her. 

EASY_A_DVS162
00:52:44,00 --> 00:52:48,50
She shows a plaque. 

EASY_A_DVS163
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:52,50
SOMEONE nods blankly. 

EASY_A_DVS164
00:52:53,00 --> 00:52:58,50
She offers a handful of condoms. 

EASY_A_DVS165
00:53:24,00 --> 00:53:31,50
Mrs. SOMEONE nods and smiles as SOMEONE collects her things. 

EASY_A_DVS166
00:53:31,00 --> 00:53:37,50
In the main office, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE comforting Micah. 

EASY_A_DVS167
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:45,50
SOMEONE squeezes his arm and murmurs. He tearfully heads toward the counselor's office. 

EASY_A_DVS168
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:52,50
She kisses her fingers, pats her hand over her heart, then raises it skyward. Micah does the same. 

EASY_A_DVS169
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:41,50
SOMEONE takes a seat beside SOMEONE, and awkwardly pats the sobbing girl's head. 

EASY_A_DVS170
00:54:51,00 --> 00:54:56,50
SOMEONE grabs her. 

EASY_A_DVS171
00:54:57,00 --> 00:55:02,50
She yanks her into a hug. 

EASY_A_DVS172
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:25,50
SOMEONE seizes her in another hug. 

EASY_A_DVS173
00:55:28,00 --> 00:55:32,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

EASY_A_DVS174
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:53,50
As they hug again, SOMEONE sniffs her hair. 

EASY_A_DVS175
00:55:56,00 --> 00:56:01,50
The next day they hug again. 

EASY_A_DVS176
00:56:07,00 --> 00:56:17,50
SOMEONE points at her phone. SOMEONE reads her text. "Hey girlie, hang after SKL today, xoxox. WWJD." 

EASY_A_DVS177
00:56:17,00 --> 00:56:26,50
SOMEONE points at her ceramics partner and mimes gagging. SOMEONE gives a sarcastic thumbs up. 

EASY_A_DVS178
00:56:36,00 --> 00:56:43,50
As they hug, SOMEONE rests her hand near a spinning table saw. 

EASY_A_DVS179
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:48,50
SOMEONE uses a wooden cross to edge it away. Now in a hospital room. 

EASY_A_DVS180
00:56:58,00 --> 00:57:03,50
His mother swats him. 

EASY_A_DVS181
00:57:02,00 --> 00:57:08,50
She smacks him again. Later she uses her cellphone. 

EASY_A_DVS182
00:57:13,00 --> 00:57:18,50
Now in the school office, SOMEONE holds a phone to her ear. 

EASY_A_DVS183
00:57:17,00 --> 00:57:22,50
Mrs. SOMEONE steps in and overhears. 

EASY_A_DVS184
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:27,50
Now SOMEONE storms into the locker room. 

EASY_A_DVS185
00:57:26,00 --> 00:57:30,50
She slaps SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS186
00:57:31,00 --> 00:57:37,50
SOMEONE smirks. Now Micah uses his cell. 

EASY_A_DVS187
00:58:11,00 --> 00:58:15,50
Mrs. SOMEONE hangs up. 

EASY_A_DVS188
00:58:12,00 --> 00:58:18,50
She paces in her office, a hand cupped over her mouth. 

EASY_A_DVS189
00:58:16,00 --> 00:58:20,50
SOMEONE walks in. 

EASY_A_DVS190
00:58:22,00 --> 00:58:29,50
She throws a photo of herself with her husband into a box, breaking the frame. 

EASY_A_DVS191
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:05,50
SOMEONE stares sympathetically at the tearful guidance counselor. 

EASY_A_DVS192
01:00:15,00 --> 01:00:19,50
Mrs. SOMEONE looks up at her. 

EASY_A_DVS193
01:00:35,00 --> 01:00:41,50
She nods emphatically. SOMEONE lays a hand on her shoulder. 

EASY_A_DVS194
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:51,50
SOMEONE winces, then lowers her hand. 

EASY_A_DVS195
01:00:50,00 --> 01:00:57,50
Mrs. SOMEONE pulls her into a hug. Her hair pokes into SOMEONE's mouth. 

EASY_A_DVS196
01:00:56,00 --> 01:01:05,50
Later SOMEONE steps outside, to find the fundamentalists holding signs reading variations of, "Olive is a slut." 

EASY_A_DVS197
01:01:19,00 --> 01:01:23,50
SOMEONE pickets. 

EASY_A_DVS198
01:01:40,00 --> 01:01:47,50
She rejoins the group. As SOMEONE starts to leave, she bumps into SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS199
01:01:46,00 --> 01:01:51,50
He glimpses at the protesters. 

EASY_A_DVS200
01:01:56,00 --> 01:02:01,50
SOMEONE turns away. 

EASY_A_DVS201
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:10,50
With her back to SOMEONE and the protesters, she wears a wounded stare as she walks away. 

EASY_A_DVS202
01:02:19,00 --> 01:02:23,50
At a bookstore. 

EASY_A_DVS203
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:42,50
Later she flips through a Bible. 

EASY_A_DVS204
01:02:53,00 --> 01:02:57,50
Now at a church. 

EASY_A_DVS205
01:02:59,00 --> 01:03:04,50
SOMEONE steps into a confessional booth. 

EASY_A_DVS206
01:03:45,00 --> 01:03:50,50
SOMEONE's large green eyes glisten. 

EASY_A_DVS207
01:03:58,00 --> 01:04:05,50
The young outcast gives a slow nod, then shrugs tearfully. 

EASY_A_DVS208
01:04:06,00 --> 01:04:14,50
Light from the confessional's grated screen cast an ornate shadow pattern against her cheek. 

EASY_A_DVS209
01:04:21,00 --> 01:04:26,50
Looking in, she finds the priest's booth empty. 

EASY_A_DVS210
01:04:25,00 --> 01:04:34,50
She leaves the confessional and rushes past a pew, knocking a Bible from the seat. She puts it back and hurries out. 

EASY_A_DVS211
01:04:49,00 --> 01:04:54,50
Now in the pastor's office. 

EASY_A_DVS212
01:05:18,00 --> 01:05:23,50
His placid smile briefly vanishes. 

EASY_A_DVS213
01:05:27,00 --> 01:05:34,50
She knocks over a family photo. Righting it, she finds SOMEONE in the picture. 

EASY_A_DVS214
01:05:39,00 --> 01:05:45,50
She topples another photo of him and SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS215
01:05:58,00 --> 01:06:04,50
Now at home, SOMEONE sits on a sectional with her mom and brother. 

EASY_A_DVS216
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:13,50
In the cafeteria. 

EASY_A_DVS217
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:47,50
SOMEONE smiles as he stands. 

EASY_A_DVS218
01:08:56,00 --> 01:09:01,50
She beams softly to herself. 

EASY_A_DVS219
01:08:58,00 --> 01:09:06,50
Nighttime at the Lobster Shack, SOMEONE shares a booth with SOMEONE who wears a demure black dress. 

EASY_A_DVS220
01:09:15,00 --> 01:09:19,50
He smiles boyishly. 

EASY_A_DVS221
01:09:20,00 --> 01:09:28,50
Under SOMEONE's unwavering gaze, SOMEONE gives a nervous nod, then looks down at the table. 

EASY_A_DVS222
01:10:32,00 --> 01:10:38,50
Wearing a plush lobster on his head, SOMEONE leads fellow servers to a table. 

EASY_A_DVS223
01:10:51,00 --> 01:10:58,50
Watching fondly, SOMEONE spies SOMEONE on the other side of a fish tank. 

EASY_A_DVS224
01:11:44,00 --> 01:11:49,50
SOMEONE spots them. 

EASY_A_DVS225
01:11:49,00 --> 01:11:54,50
Sneaking out, SOMEONE glances over and finds her staring. 

EASY_A_DVS226
01:11:53,00 --> 01:11:57,50
SOMEONE turns away. 

EASY_A_DVS227
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:00,50
Later, SOMEONE walks her to a car. 

EASY_A_DVS228
01:11:59,00 --> 01:12:04,50
She starts to open the passenger door, but he shuts it. 

EASY_A_DVS229
01:12:03,00 --> 01:12:08,50
He presents a gift card. 

EASY_A_DVS230
01:12:08,00 --> 01:12:13,50
Staring at it, SOMEONE tears up and bites her lip. 

EASY_A_DVS231
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:27,50
SOMEONE looks up at him with a wounded glare. 

EASY_A_DVS232
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:33,50
He kisses her. She pulls back. 

EASY_A_DVS233
01:12:33,00 --> 01:12:38,50
He tries again. She pushes him away. 

EASY_A_DVS234
01:12:44,00 --> 01:12:48,50
He grabs her. 

EASY_A_DVS235
01:12:47,00 --> 01:12:51,50
She shoves him. 

EASY_A_DVS236
01:12:50,00 --> 01:12:55,50
He leans in again. 

EASY_A_DVS237
01:12:53,00 --> 01:12:59,50
SOMEONE wrestles him off her. Then marches toward the restaurant. 

EASY_A_DVS238
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:05,50
She chucks the gift card at him. 

EASY_A_DVS239
01:13:03,00 --> 01:13:09,50
She turns her back to him and cries. 

EASY_A_DVS240
01:13:10,00 --> 01:13:16,50
She bites her lip hard. SOMEONE gets in his car. 

EASY_A_DVS241
01:13:15,00 --> 01:13:20,50
SOMEONE picks at the stitching of her A. 

EASY_A_DVS242
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:23,50
SOMEONE comes out from the back of the building. 

EASY_A_DVS243
01:13:22,00 --> 01:13:29,50
SOMEONE's car peals through the parking lot as the off-duty waiter approaches the tearful girl. 

EASY_A_DVS244
01:13:43,00 --> 01:13:48,50
She gives a grateful nod. 

EASY_A_DVS245
01:13:48,00 --> 01:13:54,50
Now SOMEONE drives, as SOMEONE cries in the passenger seat. 

EASY_A_DVS246
01:13:53,00 --> 01:13:58,50
She shakes her head, wincing tearfully. 

EASY_A_DVS247
01:15:51,00 --> 01:15:58,50
They smile and lock eyes. SOMEONE bashfully drops her gaze. 

EASY_A_DVS248
01:16:02,00 --> 01:16:08,50
Knitting her brow, she shakes her head. SOMEONE blinks. 

EASY_A_DVS249
01:16:44,00 --> 01:16:50,50
She unbuckles her seat belt and they share a tight embrace. 

EASY_A_DVS250
01:16:47,00 --> 01:16:52,50
SOMEONE buries his face in her shoulder. 

EASY_A_DVS251
01:16:49,00 --> 01:16:55,50
As she pulls away, he holds on to her hand. 

EASY_A_DVS252
01:16:56,00 --> 01:17:03,50
She pulls it away, and opens the door. Then swings her long slender legs outside. 

EASY_A_DVS253
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:06,50
She stands and shuts the door behind her, strolling off. 

EASY_A_DVS254
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:11,50
Facing the car once again, she leans down to peak at SOMEONE through the window. 

EASY_A_DVS255
01:17:08,00 --> 01:17:13,50
He rolls it down. And turns off the ignition. 

EASY_A_DVS256
01:17:22,00 --> 01:17:27,50
She cringes, rolling her eyes, then heads off. 

EASY_A_DVS257
01:17:28,00 --> 01:17:33,50
She grins at him over her shoulder. 

EASY_A_DVS258
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:01,50
The gossipy girl dashes off. 

EASY_A_DVS259
01:18:33,00 --> 01:18:39,50
She crumbles ice-cream cones at the chubby server. 

EASY_A_DVS260
01:18:48,00 --> 01:18:53,50
Micah scratches himself as he reads a Bible. 

EASY_A_DVS262
01:19:33,00 --> 01:19:40,50
SOMEONE stares wide-eyed. Mrs. SOMEONE smiles, and shifts in her seat. 

EASY_A_DVS263
01:19:39,00 --> 01:19:46,50
SOMEONE hurries out and runs across the quad into Mr. SOMEONE's classroom. 

EASY_A_DVS264
01:19:55,00 --> 01:20:01,50
SOMEONE's jaw drops and she shakes her head. 

EASY_A_DVS265
01:20:00,00 --> 01:20:05,50
She shifts her horrified gaze. 

EASY_A_DVS266
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:09,50
Now at her webcam. 

EASY_A_DVS267
01:20:34,00 --> 01:20:39,50
Mr. SOMEONE trudges though campus. 

EASY_A_DVS268
01:20:40,00 --> 01:20:44,50
Nighttime on the ridge. 

EASY_A_DVS269
01:21:19,00 --> 01:21:23,50
SOMEONE shows her scarf. 

EASY_A_DVS270
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:52,50
The mother kisses her daughter's head. 

EASY_A_DVS271
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:56,50
She cradles SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS272
01:22:07,00 --> 01:22:12,50
SOMEONE shows a glittery sign to her webcam. 

EASY_A_DVS273
01:22:33,00 --> 01:22:41,50
Now in a packed gym, SOMEONE rolls out the wheelbarrow. SOMEONE climbs out of the wood in a feather boa. 

EASY_A_DVS274
01:23:04,00 --> 01:23:11,50
She rips off SOMEONE's Woodchuck costume, revealing his blue devil costume. 

EASY_A_DVS275
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:16,50
They share a grin. 

EASY_A_DVS276
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:24,50
In the stands, the fundamentalists stare as other students smile and clap. 

EASY_A_DVS277
01:23:25,00 --> 01:23:30,50
SOMEONE pumps his fist. 

EASY_A_DVS278
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:39,50
SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE's cheek and gives her the feather boa. 

EASY_A_DVS279
01:23:44,00 --> 01:23:53,50
In a black corset with red stripes, SOMEONE bumps her hip at a gawking basketball player. Then smacks a dancer's rear. 

EASY_A_DVS280
01:23:51,00 --> 01:23:59,50
SOMEONE's jaw drops. SOMEONE pulls the slide of a band member's trombone, and poses with SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS281
01:24:02,00 --> 01:24:06,50
SOMEONE narrows her eyes. 

EASY_A_DVS283
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:24,50
Principal Gibbons storms over. 

EASY_A_DVS284
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:41,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE swap disgusted looks. 

EASY_A_DVS285
01:24:39,00 --> 01:24:44,50
SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's arm and scampers out with him. 

EASY_A_DVS286
01:24:41,00 --> 01:24:49,50
Later she faces her webcam as her classmates, teachers, and family watch her webcast. 

EASY_A_DVS287
01:25:15,00 --> 01:25:23,50
SOMEONE peeks outside, and finds SOMEONE standing on a lawnmower holding a pair of speakers. 

EASY_A_DVS288
01:25:39,00 --> 01:25:44,50
She faces her webcam once again. 

EASY_A_DVS289
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:57,50
Her brother stares, listening in. 

EASY_A_DVS290
01:26:07,00 --> 01:26:13,50
The webcast shows her grin and trod out the door. 

EASY_A_DVS291
01:26:17,00 --> 01:26:22,50
The pastor frowns at his laptop. 

EASY_A_DVS292
01:26:20,00 --> 01:26:26,50
SOMEONE watches on a cellphone and a truck almost hits him. 

EASY_A_DVS293
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:27,50
He hurls ice cream at it. 

EASY_A_DVS294
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:31,50
Now, Mr. SOMEONE stares steadily at his laptop. 

EASY_A_DVS295
01:26:29,00 --> 01:26:35,50
His wife smiles at him, but he ignores her. 

EASY_A_DVS296
01:26:32,00 --> 01:26:37,50
She sheepishly sucks her lips and heads off. 

EASY_A_DVS297
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:39,50
Mr., SOMEONE watches her go. 

EASY_A_DVS298
01:26:37,00 --> 01:26:43,50
In the gazebo, SOMEONE soberly touches her cross necklace. 

EASY_A_DVS299
01:26:40,00 --> 01:26:48,50
SOMEONE sits at a fountain, staring at a text that reads, "Ri, sorry I lied to you." 

EASY_A_DVS300
01:26:45,00 --> 01:26:50,50
The busty blonde gazes off tearfully. 

EASY_A_DVS301
01:26:48,00 --> 01:26:53,50
Now in a hotel room, SOMEONE lies in bed. 

EASY_A_DVS302
01:26:50,00 --> 01:26:59,50
His beefy mocha skin boyfriend snuggles up behind him and they watch Huckleberry Finn on a laptop. 

EASY_A_DVS303
01:27:06,00 --> 01:27:14,50
SOMEONE smiles. Now outside, SOMEONE leaps into SOMEONE's arms. 

EASY_A_DVS304
01:27:12,00 --> 01:27:19,50
He whirls her around, then sets her down. They share a sweet passionate kiss. 

EASY_A_DVS305
01:27:16,00 --> 01:27:22,50
SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's hand, then leads her to the lawnmower. 

EASY_A_DVS306
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:26,50
She climbs onto the rear grass-bagger as SOMEONE takes a seat at the wheel. 

EASY_A_DVS307
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:29,50
She wraps her arm around his chest and they ride off. 

EASY_A_DVS308
01:27:30,00 --> 01:27:35,50
They wheel slowly across the lawn. 

EASY_A_DVS309
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:38,50
SOMEONE raises an arm victoriously, and so does SOMEONE. 

EASY_A_DVS310
01:27:36,00 --> 01:27:40,50
Their image freezes. 

EASY_A_DVS311
01:27:42,00 --> 01:27:48,50
They drive onward, keeping their fists in the air. 

EASY_A_DVS312
01:27:45,00 --> 01:27:51,50
The mower carries them up a tree-lined road on a hill. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS13
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:58,50
The frowning beauty arrives beside SOMEONE and accidentally drops her purse. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS14
00:03:04,00 --> 00:03:09,50
As he sets it on the bar, she spies his wedding ring. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS15
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:15,50
The pair leaves. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS17
00:04:29,00 --> 00:04:34,50
She puts his hand on her breast. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS18
00:04:38,00 --> 00:04:44,50
He keeps his hand on her chest. Beverly Hills 2011. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS19
00:04:57,00 --> 00:05:03,50
He leaves a note on a young woman's pillow, Cindy I had a great night. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS20
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:06,50
P.S, thanks for not beating me like my wife does. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS21
00:05:03,00 --> 00:05:11,50
Now at a medical practice, a woman takes a stiff dark liquid filled sack from a box. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS22
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:15,50
A deliveryman eyes the product. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS23
00:05:30,00 --> 00:05:35,50
She grabs her own breast. The man reaches for it. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS24
00:05:49,00 --> 00:05:55,50
With a woman who has one eyebrow much higher than the other. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS25
00:06:03,00 --> 00:06:08,50
SOMEONE’s botched eyebrow rises even higher. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS26
00:06:14,00 --> 00:06:19,50
SOMEONE dryly lowers her chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS27
00:06:30,00 --> 00:06:35,50
Her eyebrow remains cocked. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS28
00:06:33,00 --> 00:06:37,50
She nods. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS29
00:06:44,00 --> 00:06:49,50
Her brow shoots to her hairline. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS30
00:07:08,00 --> 00:07:13,50
As he hugs her, she waggles her brows. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS31
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:18,50
SOMEONE's cousin arrives. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS32
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:23,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS33
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:32,50
Now stylish guests attend a hip party at a mansion overlooking the ocean. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS34
00:08:29,00 --> 00:08:36,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE approach a man with an unnaturally stiff, smooth face. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS35
00:09:23,00 --> 00:09:28,50
As they down drinks, wine spills down his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS36
00:09:36,00 --> 00:09:40,50
Now in a bathroom. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS37
00:09:40,00 --> 00:09:44,50
SOMEONE pockets his ring. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS38
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:05,50
He gives Ariel a shot, then smacks him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS39
00:10:18,00 --> 00:10:22,50
Later, they leave the bathroom. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS40
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:31,50
Clad in a filmy cerulean dress, a young statuesque beauty with sun-kissed skin and long blonde hair approaches SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS41
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:35,50
The longtime bachelor stops in his tracks and stares. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS42
00:11:04,00 --> 00:11:12,50
As the pair steps outside, Adon struggles to close his lips around his straw. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS43
00:11:23,00 --> 00:11:28,50
A taut-faced woman. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS44
00:11:47,00 --> 00:11:51,50
Later on the beach. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS45
00:12:54,00 --> 00:13:03,50
SOMEONE leans in and kisses him. Their arms twine around each other and they sway on their feet. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS47
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:09,50
In a nock encased by tall rock formations, SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie between two blankets. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS48
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:49,50
Digging through his pockets, SOMEONE finds the wedding ring. Her smile vanishes as she holds it up. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS49
00:14:15,00 --> 00:14:19,50
She chucks the ring at him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS50
00:14:17,00 --> 00:14:23,50
She marches down the beach. Now at SOMEONE's medical practice. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS51
00:14:33,00 --> 00:14:39,50
SOMEONE tosses her hair and smiles vapidly. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS52
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:20,50
Two kids enter with a stout SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS53
00:15:51,00 --> 00:15:56,50
The SOMEONE plays a hand-held video game. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS54
00:18:46,00 --> 00:18:51,50
SOMEONE faces him with a wide-eyed smirk. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS55
00:18:51,00 --> 00:19:02,50
Now at a private school, SOMEONE leads a student through a crowded hallway. SOMEONE enters with flowers. Seeing him, the young teacher turns away. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS56
00:19:06,00 --> 00:19:12,50
She dumps the extravagant bouquet in a trash bin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS57
00:19:26,00 --> 00:19:31,50
SOMEONE takes him to a classroom. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS59
00:21:23,00 --> 00:21:30,50
SOMEONE faces a window. From the other side, Silas glares and points menacingly. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS60
00:21:29,00 --> 00:21:34,50
On Rodeo Drive. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS61
00:22:21,00 --> 00:22:28,50
Now in a high-end store, she wobbles in a pair of four-inch heels. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS62
00:23:39,00 --> 00:23:44,50
SOMEONE gives her a gentle shove, and she falls over. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS63
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:48,50
Now SOMEONE eyes a vast display of designer handbags. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS64
00:23:45,00 --> 00:23:51,50
Later, SOMEONE carries a few shopping bags in each hand, as he follows her. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS65
00:23:49,00 --> 00:23:56,50
In a store, SOMEONE tries on one stylish curve-hugging dress after another. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS66
00:23:53,00 --> 00:23:59,50
SOMEONE gives her a playful shove, and she swats at him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS67
00:23:56,00 --> 00:24:01,50
She shakes her hips, and they laugh. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS68
00:23:58,00 --> 00:24:08,50
Later, SOMEONE follows her out of Tiffany's, loaded down with shopping bags. Now a hairdresser eyes SOMEONE appraisingly. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS69
00:24:09,00 --> 00:24:14,50
She frowns as he coldly approaches. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS70
00:24:12,00 --> 00:24:19,50
Bending down, he takes up handfuls of her long honey-brown hair and peers closely at it. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS71
00:25:08,00 --> 00:25:14,50
Now at an upscale sunlit lounge. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS72
00:25:27,00 --> 00:25:37,50
From a stairway, SOMEONE ascends into view in a white sheet dress that shows off her long tan legs and graceful curves. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS73
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:44,50
Her hair tousled in sexy waves, she smirks through glamorous sunglasses. A distinguished man in a suit trails her dutifully. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS74
00:25:41,00 --> 00:25:48,50
SOMEONE turns and her jaw drops at the site of the other woman. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS75
00:25:50,00 --> 00:25:56,50
Moving in slow motion, SOMEONE blows a kiss to a stranger. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS76
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:51,50
She slaps the waiter's rear. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS77
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:01,50
SOMEONE nearly chokes on her red wine. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS78

00:29:02,00 --> 00:29:07,50
She kicks SOMEONE hard in the shin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS80
00:29:16,00 --> 00:29:20,50
Later, they leave. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS81
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:20,50
Facing SOMEONE, she finds him staring pointedly at her. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS82
00:30:39,00 --> 00:30:44,50
She abruptly gets in the limo. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS83
00:30:45,00 --> 00:30:51,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE, who stares agog at him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS84
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:32,50
At Pizza Hut. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS85
00:31:44,00 --> 00:31:49,50
The SOMEONE salsa dances around a janitor. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS86
00:32:49,00 --> 00:32:54,50
They shake hands on it. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS87
00:32:55,00 --> 00:33:00,50
SOMEONE faces her younger brother. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS88
00:33:09,00 --> 00:33:18,50
SOMEONE pours soda into his glass, then takes a sip through a straw. All the while, keeping a cold glare fixed on SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS89
00:34:04,00 --> 00:34:10,50
SOMEONE sucks on his straw as if it's a cigarette. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS90
00:34:11,00 --> 00:34:17,50
The girl picks up her slice and winces at it. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS92
00:34:28,00 --> 00:34:33,50
A woman with mismatched breasts. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS93
00:34:31,00 --> 00:34:36,50
They go to the exam room. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS94
00:34:53,00 --> 00:34:59,50
SOMEONE meets his gaze, sheepishly. SOMEONE grins. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS95
00:35:13,00 --> 00:35:18,50
He wags his finger in his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS96
00:35:54,00 --> 00:35:59,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS97
00:36:07,00 --> 00:36:13,50
He reaches for her phone. She swats him away, then answers. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS98
00:36:23,00 --> 00:36:30,50
She ends the call. Returning to Mrs. Harrington, she finds SOMEONE staring at her. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS99
00:37:12,00 --> 00:37:16,50
A lopsided bra. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS100
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:39,50
He wiggles his finger from his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS101
00:37:42,00 --> 00:37:47,50
Outside, JD McFunnigans.

SOMEONE steps out of her car in a tight dress. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS103
00:38:37,00 --> 00:38:45,50
In slow motion, SOMEONE, SOMEONE and the kids try to cross the parking lot. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS104
00:38:44,00 --> 00:38:55,50
A boy holding a soda cup runs out in front of them. He stops and turns. As his pregnant mother catches up, he chucks the full cup at her and runs off. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS105
00:38:53,00 --> 00:39:00,50
Soaked with soda, the pregnant woman raises her hands overhand and yells after him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS106
00:39:00,00 --> 00:39:08,50
Everyone still moving in slow motion, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the kids watch the furious woman chase after her 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS108
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:21,50
Inside, children run wildly through an elaborate play structure with tunnels, slides, and climbing ropes. SOMEONE enters with SOMEONE and the kids. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS109
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:33,50
A chubby boy trips and head-butts SOMEONE in the crotch.

00:40:18,00 --> 00:40:23,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a look.

00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:06,50
She runs away. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS114
00:41:11,00 --> 00:41:17,50
SOMEONE leaves and SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS115
00:41:21,00 --> 00:41:26,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE through the play structure. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS116
00:41:50,00 --> 00:41:56,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE look up from the floor. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS117
00:42:01,00 --> 00:42:06,50
A little boy sneezes on SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS119
00:42:22,00 --> 00:42:26,50
SOMEONE eyes him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS120
00:42:36,00 --> 00:42:40,50
She beams and takes a bite. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS121
00:42:40,00 --> 00:42:45,50
SOMEONE mouths, Thank you. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS122
00:43:37,00 --> 00:43:42,50
SOMEONE returns. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS123
00:44:07,00 --> 00:44:13,50
SOMEONE grins at him, then hangs his head and cries. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS124
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:17,50
Now at LAX, SOMEONE sits with SOMEONE and the kids in a busy airport terminal. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS125
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:12,50
A bespectacled SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE on the lips until she pushes him off. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS126
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:04,50
He wags his tongue, and SOMEONE catches it. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS127
00:46:06,00 --> 00:46:12,50
She drags him aside and wipes her hand on his vest. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS128
00:46:15,00 --> 00:46:20,50
He points to his round glasses. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS129
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:57,50
SOMEONE backhands him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS130
00:46:57,00 --> 00:47:03,50
Now a Hawaiian airliner soars over turquoise water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS131
00:47:00,00 --> 00:47:08,50
On the island, a luxurious beachside resort boasts several swimming pools on its manicured grounds. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS132
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:15,50
Beyond a large reflecting pool in the lobby, the family arrives. SOMEONE approaches the registration desk. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS133
00:47:44,00 --> 00:47:50,50
SOMEONE takes out his credit card then returns to the others. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS134
00:47:56,00 --> 00:48:15,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE raise their hands. Now on a palm tree lined beach, SOMEONE steps out of the water in a yellow string bikini. SOMEONE and SOMEONE check her out as they cross the sand. The voluptuous young woman brushes back her long blonde hair. Ogling her, SOMEONE lifts his round glasses. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS135
00:48:46,00 --> 00:48:53,50
SOMEONE walks his fingers up SOMEONE's arm. Later outside a jewelry store. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS136
00:49:55,00 --> 00:50:02,50
Nighttime at a luau, fire dancers perform while the group eats dinner.

00:50:34,00 --> 00:50:39,50
SOMEONE takes a pitcher from the waiter. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS138
00:51:16,00 --> 00:51:21,50
The kids swap a look. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS139
00:52:19,00 --> 00:52:24,50
The petite redhead flounces over. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS140
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:03,50
He kisses SOMEONE's cheek.

00:54:53,00 --> 00:54:57,50
SOMEONE squints at them. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS142
00:55:03,00 --> 00:55:07,50
The guys pound fists. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS143
00:56:01,00 --> 00:56:05,50
Dawn in the lobby. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS144
00:56:30,00 --> 00:56:36,50
Now in a lush tropical forest, the group hikes a trail. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS145
00:56:46,00 --> 00:56:54,50
The black-haired pig charges them and they run. SOMEONE knocks SOMEONE down, and the pig steps on his back. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS146
00:56:56,00 --> 00:57:02,50
Later, the group hikes a narrow trail beside a canyon. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS147
00:56:59,00 --> 00:57:09,50
SOMEONE scales a steep hill, while the others lag behind. Hiking through bamboo stalks, she leads the group up another incline. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS148
00:57:06,00 --> 00:57:15,50
On a river, they paddle two-person canoes. Sitting behind SOMEONE, SOMEONE gawks at the exposed crack of her rear. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS149
00:57:13,00 --> 00:57:17,50
SOMEONE whacks him with her paddle. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS150
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:29,50
Now as all six of them cross a rope bridge, a family of four spots them from below. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS151
00:57:34,00 --> 00:57:39,50
SOMEONE stands at the tail end. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS152
00:57:38,00 --> 00:57:44,50
A board breaks, and he lands on a crossbeam, crotch first. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS154
00:57:52,00 --> 00:57:57,50
SOMEONE chucks SOMEONE into a mud puddle. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS155
00:57:55,00 --> 00:58:01,50
She lifts her face from the sticky muck. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS156
00:58:01,00 --> 00:58:06,50
Now at a lagoon with a waterfall. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS157
00:58:19,00 --> 00:58:25,50
SOMEONE strips down to a skimpy string bikini. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS158
00:58:25,00 --> 00:58:30,50
She goes to the water's edge.

00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:12,50
SOMEONE shyly whispers to his mother. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS163
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:47,50
On the far side of the lagoon, SOMEONE emerges from the water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS164
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:52,50
She picks her way over some jagged rocks, and stands beneath the waterfall. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS165
01:00:00,00 --> 01:00:05,50
He tries to high five SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS166
01:00:22,00 --> 01:00:29,50
SOMEONE strips down to a pink string bikini, revealing her tan slender body. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS167
01:00:26,00 --> 01:00:31,50
In slow motion, she saunters to the water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS168
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:36,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare slack-jawed at SOMEONE's well-toned figure. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS169
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:45,50
SOMEONE steps away. SOMEONE picks her way out to a rocky point. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS170
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:58,50
SOMEONE dives into the water. Cladding briefs with frogs printed on them, SOMEONE climbs rocks by the waterfall. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS171
01:00:57,00 --> 01:01:02,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE lounge near-by. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS172
01:01:05,00 --> 01:01:10,50
He drops to the water, landing on his back. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS173
01:01:10,00 --> 01:01:16,50
Now back at the hotel, the group disembarks from a shuttle. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS174
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:48,50
Evening in SOMEONE's suite. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS175
01:02:44,00 --> 01:02:49,50
He wags his finger from his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS176
01:03:17,00 --> 01:03:22,50
As she leaves, SOMEONE approaches her in the hallway.

01:03:21,00 --> 01:03:27,50
SOMEONE punches him in the gut and keeps walking.

01:03:29,00 --> 01:03:34,50
SOMEONE draws a card and reads. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS180
01:04:07,00 --> 01:04:11,50
SOMEONE draws a card. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS181
01:04:29,00 --> 01:04:33,50
SOMEONE shrugs. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS182
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:53,50
As he cries, SOMEONE goes to comfort him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS183
01:04:51,00 --> 01:04:56,50
SOMEONE glares at SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS184
01:05:02,00 --> 01:05:06,50
SOMEONE storms off. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS185
01:05:09,00 --> 01:05:16,50
SOMEONE holds her crying brother in her arms. Turning, SOMEONE smacks his shoulder. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS186
01:05:15,00 --> 01:05:19,50
Now he tucks them in. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS187
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:07,50
SOMEONE looks in on them. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS188
01:06:30,00 --> 01:06:37,50
SOMEONE leaves. SOMEONE shoves the kids back down on the bed. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS189
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:45,50
Now on a putting green overlooking the ocean. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS190
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:21,50
He gives her the putting flag. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS191
01:08:31,00 --> 01:08:40,50
The flag juts up from his butt cheeks. Now by the hotel pool, he wears water wings. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS192
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:50,50
SOMEONE tosses him into the pool. SOMEONE surfaces and scoops him up in his arms. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS193
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:00,50
Later, SOMEONE holds SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS194
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:11,50
SOMEONE puppets a dolphin shaped cookie. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS195
01:09:25,00 --> 01:09:36,50
SOMEONE flails his arms and kicks his legs. Slowly making his way towards the pool's edge. As he arrives, SOMEONE feeds him the cookie and tousles his wet hair. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS196
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:44,50
At a spa. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS197
01:09:42,00 --> 01:09:46,50
The women get massages. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS198
01:10:37,00 --> 01:10:42,50
SOMEONE's brow furrows. At the pool. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS199
01:10:53,00 --> 01:10:58,50
SOMEONE takes off his water wings. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS200
01:11:12,00 --> 01:11:21,50
SOMEONE tosses SOMEONE from his arms, and the little boy flails and kicks his way across the pool. SOMEONE and SOMEONE arrive. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS201
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:27,50
SOMEONE's head dips below the water, and he lifts it back out. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS202
01:11:35,00 --> 01:11:44,50
SOMEONE reaches the pool's edge, high fives his mother and grins broadly. SOMEONE happily picks up SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS203
01:11:53,00 --> 01:11:59,50
SOMEONE removes her sunglasses, and smiles lovingly at SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS204
01:11:56,00 --> 01:12:04,50
Beside her, SOMEONE takes off her shades and regards him with a fond gaze. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS205
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:10,50
SOMEONE drops SOMEONE in the water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS206
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:26,50
SOMEONE urges SOMEONE to intervene. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS207
01:12:54,00 --> 01:12:59,50
SOMEONE shoves SOMEONE into the pool. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS208
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:04,50
He jumps in the water, dunks her and holds her under. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS209
01:13:33,00 --> 01:13:38,50
He lets SOMEONE up, and she splashes him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS210
01:13:41,00 --> 01:13:46,50
In SOMEONE's suite, he talks on the phone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS211
01:13:53,00 --> 01:14:02,50
SOMEONE emerges from the bathroom, wrapped in a towel. Reclining on a sofa, SOMEONE struggles to sit up. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS212
01:14:23,00 --> 01:14:30,50
SOMEONE drops her towel. SOMEONE tosses an apple between his hands. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS213
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:34,50
He resumes his call. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS214
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:53,50
SOMEONE enters the bathroom. In the shower, SOMEONE dances and lip-syncs. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS215
01:14:57,00 --> 01:15:01,50
He switches off the music. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS216
01:15:04,00 --> 01:15:10,50
SOMEONE joins SOMEONE, eating a mango she thrusts the phone at him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS217
01:15:16,00 --> 01:15:20,50
She smacks him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS218
01:15:53,00 --> 01:15:57,50
He ends the call. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS219
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:20,50
She gestures to the bathroom, where a pillow and a blanket sit in the tub. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS220
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:28,50
Now at an upscale restaurant, a woman gracefully hula dances to music by a live band. At a table, SOMEONE scrutinizes a wine list. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS221
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:09,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE pout and rub noses. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS222
01:17:09,00 --> 01:17:19,50
SOMEONE notices SOMEONE staring at his lap. She receives a text from him reading, I think they took one of your yellow bombers. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS223
01:17:16,00 --> 01:17:25,50
Glancing at the couple, she suppresses a grin. SOMEONE receives her reply. I just hope their noses are clean. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS224
01:17:36,00 --> 01:17:43,50
Now a hybrid car pulls up to a dilapidated outdoor barbecue restaurant. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS225
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:05,50
At dinner, SOMEONE and SOMEONE swap a look. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS226
01:18:04,00 --> 01:18:09,50
The waitress pours wine. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS227
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:33,50
SOMEONE gapes. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS228
01:19:18,00 --> 01:19:22,50
He faces SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS229
01:19:26,00 --> 01:19:31,50
They rub their noses together. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS230
01:19:31,00 --> 01:19:35,50
SOMEONE leaves. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS231
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:53,50
With SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS232
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:25,50
The local girl leads them around back. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS233
01:20:23,00 --> 01:20:33,50
A crowd gathers. SOMEONE nervously approaches the white sheep, which lies on its side. He pokes it a few times. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS234
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:53,50
With SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS235
01:22:37,00 --> 01:22:42,50
SOMEONE mockingly mimes an overbite. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS236
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:39,50
Gazing into his eyes, SOMEONE softly nods. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS237
01:23:36,00 --> 01:23:42,50
SOMEONE meets her gaze, and nods as well. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS238
01:23:49,00 --> 01:23:57,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE shift in their seats. Meanwhile, SOMEONE waves the limp sheep's legs. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS239
01:24:03,00 --> 01:24:09,50
He shoves hay in its mouth and grabs her udder. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS240
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:15,50
He does CPR. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS241
01:24:16,00 --> 01:24:21,50
He drops his elbow into its belly. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS242
01:24:25,00 --> 01:24:29,50
He tries the Heimlich maneuver. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS243
01:24:34,00 --> 01:24:39,50
A plastic fish pops out, and the sheep walks away. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS244
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:44,50
The girl hugs SOMEONE, then he gives her the Heimlich maneuver. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS245
01:25:37,00 --> 01:25:41,50
SOMEONE downs a shot. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS246
01:25:43,00 --> 01:25:47,50
She downs another. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS248
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:59,50
SOMEONE leads a group of ladies in bra tops and grass skirts. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS249
01:26:04,00 --> 01:26:12,50
SOMEONE re-positions herself center-stage in front of her rival. The ladies start to dance. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS250
01:26:19,00 --> 01:26:25,50
He holds his hand over an elderly woman. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS251
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:31,50
As he guides her off stage, SOMEONE gives her a hug. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS252
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:43,50
Tanner highlights SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS253
01:26:45,00 --> 01:26:49,50
He moves on to SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS254
01:26:53,00 --> 01:26:59,50
A heavy-set woman shimmies in a coconut top. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS255
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:04,50
She storms off. Only SOMEONE and SOMEONE remain. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS256
01:27:06,00 --> 01:27:12,50
SOMEONE raises her arms overhead and shakes her hips. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS257
01:27:11,00 --> 01:27:19,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE, then matches her hip action. SOMEONE glares. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS258
01:27:16,00 --> 01:27:24,50
The tall redhead shakes her head and circles her bent arms, then points to SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS259
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:34,50
SOMEONE looks to SOMEONE, who gestures forward to show off her own moves. She shrugs her shoulders, then does a break dancing arm wave, and stops facing SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS260
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:46,50
SOMEONE opens his arms. SOMEONE glances at her opponent, then breaks into a lively Charleston, kicking up her heels. She twirls like a ballerina, then points back to SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS261
01:27:46,00 --> 01:27:58,50
SOMEONE lowers her center of gravity, then mimes as though she were juggling. She juggles pretend balls behind her back, catches them in her bosom and throws one to SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS262
01:28:00,00 --> 01:28:09,50
SOMEONE watches her rival. With her back to the crowd, SOMEONE gyrates her rear. Slow at first, then faster, and faster. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS263
01:28:08,00 --> 01:28:16,50
SOMEONE does the same, until SOMEONE does an aerial cartwheel, twirls and drops into a split. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS264
01:28:13,00 --> 01:28:19,50
She raises her arm in a final pose. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS265
01:28:21,00 --> 01:28:29,50
SOMEONE hulas in front of SOMEONE, then shakes her hips while raising her arms overhead. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS266
01:28:29,00 --> 01:28:37,50
SOMEONE pushes SOMEONE out of the way and poses again. She gets up and blows SOMEONE kisses. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS268
01:29:02,00 --> 01:29:08,50
SOMEONE flashes her rear, and all of the men stand up. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS269
01:29:10,00 --> 01:29:15,50
SOMEONE grabs the mic. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS270
01:29:15,00 --> 01:29:21,50
Later, each couple holds a coconut between them. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS271
01:29:38,00 --> 01:29:44,50
Both couples struggle to raise their coconuts above their bellies. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS272
01:29:52,00 --> 01:29:59,50
SOMEONE kneels, resting the coconut at SOMEONE's waist on her cleavage. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS273
01:29:59,00 --> 01:30:05,50
SOMEONE's chin holds the coconut at SOMEONE's crotch. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS274
01:30:04,00 --> 01:30:10,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE bring their coconut up to their chests. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS275
01:30:13,00 --> 01:30:19,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE drop their coconut on the floor. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS276
01:30:24,00 --> 01:30:29,50
SOMEONE lowers his butt over the coconut. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS277
01:30:27,00 --> 01:30:33,50
He lifts the coconut off of the floor. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS278
01:30:37,00 --> 01:30:43,50
He waddles around, then lifts his backside to SOMEONE's waist. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS279
01:30:46,00 --> 01:30:52,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold their coconut between their necks. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS280
01:31:04,00 --> 01:31:11,50
With their mouth under their coconut, SOMEONE pushes it up to SOMEONE's lips. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS281
01:31:12,00 --> 01:31:19,50
SOMEONE drops hers. With their eyes locked, SOMEONE and SOMEONE let their coconut fall. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS282
01:31:20,00 --> 01:31:25,50
SOMEONE storms off. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS283
01:31:22,00 --> 01:31:27,50
SOMEONE follows. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS285
01:31:50,00 --> 01:31:54,50
At SOMEONE's door. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS286
01:33:25,00 --> 01:33:30,50
He wags his finger at his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS287
01:34:00,00 --> 01:34:06,50
SOMEONE jolts, then hugs her kids. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS288
01:34:14,00 --> 01:34:19,50
An obese woman sleeps on a couch. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS289
01:34:39,00 --> 01:34:43,50
They shake hands. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS290
01:34:48,00 --> 01:34:55,50
As SOMEONE walks away, SOMEONE slowly shuts the door to her suite. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS291
01:34:54,00 --> 01:35:02,50
Now SOMEONE steps off of an elevator and crosses a hallway, with his hand shoved in his pockets. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS292
01:35:01,00 --> 01:35:08,50
At the end of another hall, he reaches the door to his own suite and stops. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS293
01:35:12,00 --> 01:35:21,50
Rounding a corner, he breaks into a run. SOMEONE jogs back to the elevators and presses the call button. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS294
01:35:21,00 --> 01:35:25,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE step out. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS295
01:36:13,00 --> 01:36:18,50
SOMEONE points to his ring finger. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS296
01:36:42,00 --> 01:36:48,50
The elevator opens and SOMEONE freezes. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS297
01:37:41,00 --> 01:37:47,50
She shares a gaze with SOMEONE as the elevator doors close. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS298
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:51,50
Later, we drift over a bed, to find SOMEONE lying alone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS299
01:37:49,00 --> 01:37:56,50
Staring thoughtfully, he fondles his wedding ring between his fingertips. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS300
01:37:54,00 --> 01:38:02,50
In the next room, SOMEONE tries on short white dresses while chatting on the phone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS301
01:38:03,00 --> 01:38:12,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE lies awake in bed. She restlessly wipes her nose, and flips on her other side. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS302
01:38:12,00 --> 01:38:18,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE sleeps in the cramped tub. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS303
01:38:16,00 --> 01:38:22,50
As he turns on his side, his left hand lands in the toilet. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS304
01:38:21,00 --> 01:38:28,50
Later, SOMEONE lies sound asleep, resting her head on SOMEONE's shoulder. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS305
01:38:25,00 --> 01:38:31,50
He remains awake, staring blankly across the room. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS306
01:38:30,00 --> 01:38:36,50
SOMEONE lies awake in bed. SOMEONE rests beside her. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS307
01:38:37,00 --> 01:38:44,50
The brown-haired girl takes her mother's hand and rests her head on SOMEONE's pillow. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS308
01:38:47,00 --> 01:38:55,50
Half asleep, SOMEONE ambles into the bathroom, where SOMEONE still sleeps with his hand in the toilet. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS309
01:38:56,00 --> 01:39:05,50
The bed-headed boy drops his shorts, then sits on the bowl hunched forward with his arms dangling between his knees. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS310
01:39:07,00 --> 01:39:13,50
SOMEONE wakes, noticing his hand, and yanks it out of the bowl. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS311
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:20,50
He grabs a towel and wraps his arm. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS312
01:39:24,00 --> 01:39:28,50
He storms out past the boy. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS313
01:39:27,00 --> 01:39:36,50
Later, SOMEONE steps outside. Surrounded by tropical plants and lit candles, he makes a call on a portable phone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS314
01:39:38,00 --> 01:39:43,50
SOMEONE answers a bedside phone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS315
01:41:23,00 --> 01:41:28,50
SOMEONE shakes his head. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS316
01:41:43,00 --> 01:41:48,50
SOMEONE pensively rubs his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS317
01:41:53,00 --> 01:42:00,50
Perched on the edge of a hot tub, SOMEONE stares ahead and lowers the phone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS318
01:41:58,00 --> 01:42:05,50
Now silhouetted against the moonlit ocean, a pod of dolphins leap from the water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS320
01:42:03,00 --> 01:42:09,50
In the lobby, SOMEONE faces the concierge. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS321
01:42:14,00 --> 01:42:18,50
SOMEONE arrives nearby. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS322
01:42:22,00 --> 01:42:29,50
The blonde approaches wearing a white dress and a magnolia in her hair. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS323
01:43:24,00 --> 01:43:32,50
As SOMEONE hugs her, SOMEONE spies SOMEONE helping her kids pick out clothes in a gift shop. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS324
01:43:30,00 --> 01:43:36,50
She watches him with wistful lovelorn gaze. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS325
01:43:33,00 --> 01:43:42,50
Now in an outdoor beachfront bar, SOMEONE finishes off a tropical cocktail, as the bartender brings her another. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS326
01:43:58,00 --> 01:44:03,50
SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS327
01:44:39,00 --> 01:44:44,50
SOMEONE sips a cocktail. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS328
01:45:07,00 --> 01:45:13,50
SOMEONE regards her with a sober frown. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS329
01:45:15,00 --> 01:45:20,50
SOMEONE shrugs her hand. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS330
01:45:21,00 --> 01:45:26,50
SOMEONE checks up sailors. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS331
01:45:37,00 --> 01:45:44,50
Across the bar, SOMEONE clownishly hula dances for the sailors. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS332
01:46:07,00 --> 01:46:11,50
The two women hug. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS333
01:46:12,00 --> 01:46:17,50
SOMEONE sits next to them. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS334
01:46:27,00 --> 01:46:32,50
SOMEONE doubles over laughing with the sailors. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS335
01:47:22,00 --> 01:47:26,50
He cocks his head patiently. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS336
01:48:07,00 --> 01:48:14,50
SOMEONE tilts his head and grins. Beaming, SOMEONE shakes her head fondly. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS337
01:48:11,00 --> 01:48:19,50
Her old friend gives a small nod. Leaning in, she gives him a passionate kiss. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS338
01:48:17,00 --> 01:48:22,50
The sailors and SOMEONE watch. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS339
01:48:22,00 --> 01:48:28,50
Now in a life-vest, SOMEONE faces a dolphin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS340
01:48:33,00 --> 01:48:38,50
Two push him through the water with their noses. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS341
01:48:36,00 --> 01:48:40,50
On an airplane. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS342
01:48:43,00 --> 01:48:47,50
Now at a wedding reception. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS343
01:48:49,00 --> 01:48:53,50
SOMEONE sits alone.

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS347
01:49:39,00 --> 01:49:47,50

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS348
01:49:49,00 --> 01:50:00,50
Grinning, SOMEONE pulls him close. The couple sways happily in unison as their friends and loved ones celebrate around them. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS5
00:03:43,00 --> 00:03:46,50
At the guys house 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS6
00:04:35,00 --> 00:04:39,50

SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE wearily. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS14
00:16:44,00 --> 00:16:50,50
Daytime. The pool sparkles outside the guesthouse. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS15
00:16:50,00 --> 00:16:56,50
Now a pale chubby butt lies naked under tangled sheets. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS16
00:16:55,00 --> 00:17:03,50
SOMEONE, standing and dressed, wrinkles her brow at SOMEONE's butt. She bounces the mattress with her foot. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS17
00:17:03,00 --> 00:17:07,50
She bounces it harder. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS18

Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE step out of the guesthouse. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS23
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:06,50
SOMEONE in a well-cut suit. In front of the house they walk across the lawn as SOMEONE carries the baby toward them. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS24
00:18:10,00 --> 00:18:14,50
They shake hands. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS25
00:18:24,00 --> 00:18:29,50

SOMEONE sits back down. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS30
00:21:52,00 --> 00:21:56,50
Eight weeks later.

00:22:42,00 --> 00:22:47,50
SOMEONE and an editor watch James on a computer monitor. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS32
00:23:13,00 --> 00:23:17,50
She swallows hard. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS33
00:23:16,00 --> 00:23:24,50
SOMEONE touches her throat and heaves forward. She claps a hand over her mouth. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS34
00:23:27,00 --> 00:23:32,50
Raising his hands overhead. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS35
00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:38,50
SOMEONE slowly sits back up. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS36
00:23:47,00 --> 00:23:51,50
She wipes her mouth. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS37
00:23:55,00 --> 00:24:00,50
She takes another swipe at her mouth, then freezes 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS38
00:24:58,00 --> 00:25:02,50
She leans back. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS39
00:26:11,00 --> 00:26:15,50

KNOCKED_UP_DVS40
00:26:14,00 --> 00:26:18,50
SOMEONE gazes off. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS41
00:26:43,00 --> 00:26:47,50
A web page reads, Coming Soon. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS42
00:26:51,00 --> 00:26:55,50
The screen shows the guys email address. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS43
00:26:54,00 --> 00:26:58,50
An email pops up. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS44
00:27:01,00 --> 00:27:08,50
SOMEONE wrinkles her nose. Now in their backyard the guys smoke. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS45
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:56,50

SOMEONE forces a smile. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS48
00:32:04,00 --> 00:32:09,50
He leans back in his chair. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS49
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:37,50
Now in an exam room, a smiling doctor enters. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS50
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:55,50
SOMEONE's eyes shift. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS51
00:33:04,00 --> 00:33:08,50
Puts her feet in the stir-ups and the doctor 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS52
00:33:06,00 --> 00:33:11,50
covers her legs with a blanket. SOMEONE glances around uncomfortably. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS53
00:33:15,00 --> 00:33:18,50
The blanket. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS54
00:33:18,00 --> 00:33:25,50
SOMEONE gazes at the ceiling. The doctor squeezes gel onto the end of a wand. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS55
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:37,50
Smiles indulgently as the doctor forces a smile and inserts the wand. SOMEONE shifts. An image appears on a monitor. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS56
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:20,50
She is sobbing face. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS57

SOMEONE gestures to his chubby friend. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS65
00:40:12,00 --> 00:40:17,50
His amiable smile fades as he eyes her body. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS66
00:40:18,00 --> 00:40:23,50
They gaze at her through blurry eyes. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS67
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:31,50
As SOMEONE leaves the room SOMEONE sits. SOMEONE, SOMEONE and SOMEONE, all stare at the TV. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS68
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:42,50
SOMEONE follows their gaze to a clip from Wild Things. Neve Campbell kisses a topless Denise Richards in a swimming pool. SOMEONE shrugs. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS69
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:48,50
On screen, SOMEONE removes SOMEONE's shirt. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS70
00:42:13,00 --> 00:42:18,50
Little hat and holds a tiny outfit. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS71
00:43:09,00 --> 00:43:20,50
SOMEONE walk outside they tentatively hold hands. Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand in their bathroom facing opposite directions. Brushing his teeth he turns to face her. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS72
00:43:25,00 --> 00:43:30,50
She dabs under her eyes with her fingertips. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS73
00:43:45,00 --> 00:43:49,50
Shifts his stunned gaze. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS74
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:55,50
Now in the guesthouse SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a tender passionate kiss. He gazes into her eyes.

00:43:57,00 --> 00:44:01,50
SOMEONE pulls away. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS76
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:34,50
SOMEONE sits on the bed and pulls SOMEONE down beside her. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS77
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:56,50
SOMEONE gives a slow thoughtful nod. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS78
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:28,50
Face each other sharing a warm smile. They lean close and enjoy a tender kiss. Pulling away slightly. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS79
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:07,50
Takes a long sip of coffee. The toddler beams at SOMEONE. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS80
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:17,50
He lifts his brow and smiles. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS81
00:47:20,00 --> 00:47:26,50

Her sister forces a smile. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS85
00:49:15,00 --> 00:49:22,50
Now outside the rental house, SOMEONE and SOMEONE play Ping-Pong while the others watch. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS87
00:52:40,00 --> 00:52:46,50
Now under an ultrasound video words appear. Sixteen weeks. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS88
00:52:44,00 --> 00:52:49,50
A wardrobe lady fits SOMEONE with a belt. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS89
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:05,50
A female executive passes by. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS90
00:55:14,00 --> 00:55:19,50
SOMEONE gives a defensive shrug 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS91
00:55:28,00 --> 00:55:36,50
A Baby Bjorn Baby Sling box shows a couple beaming at each other. SOMEONE winces at the picture then shows it to SOMEONE. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS92
00:55:49,00 --> 00:55:55,50
They join SOMEONE at a crib. He eyes the price tag. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS93
00:56:25,00 --> 00:56:29,50

Now a website shows a grinning cartoon logo. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS97
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:33,50
He remains behind and sits facing SOMEONE who thoughtfully tokes on a joint. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS98
00:58:55,00 --> 00:58:59,50
Now in the guesthouse. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS99
00:59:29,00 --> 00:59:33,50
SOMEONE's eyes glisten. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS100
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:42,50
SOMEONE's bed. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS101
01:01:45,00 --> 01:01:49,50
In SOMEONE's car. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS102
01:02:41,00 --> 01:02:45,50
Now under an ultrasound video. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS103
01:05:24,00 --> 01:05:29,50
SOMEONE drains his glass and pounds the table. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS104
01:05:31,00 --> 01:05:37,50
Now in his bedroom SOMEONE lies on top of SOMEONE. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS105
01:07:04,00 --> 01:07:08,50
Now she lies sideways with her back. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS106

Later SOMEONE sits in the living room. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS107
01:08:43,00 --> 01:08:48,50
A woman covers her bare breast. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS108
01:08:50,00 --> 01:08:54,50
SOMEONE shakes his hand exposing... 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS109
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:30,50
SOMEONE shrugs at the passing cruiser. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS110
01:09:29,00 --> 01:09:43,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit by the open cabinet among piles of stuff. She touches an overturned marijuana plant and a large branch breaks off in her hand. Dropping it, she finds a bank statement with SOMEONE's name on it. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS111
01:09:41,00 --> 01:09:47,50
It reads $117.13. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS113

With her mouth agape she drops the books 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS118
01:10:29,00 --> 01:10:34,50
into the bag, then stares off with a pensive expression. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS119
01:10:36,00 --> 01:10:40,50
Beneath an ultrasound showing a fetus. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS120
01:10:49,00 --> 01:10:53,50
SOMEONE answers the phone. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS121
01:12:07,00 --> 01:12:12,50
As SOMEONE leaves, SOMEONE smiles at SOMEONE. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS122
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:20,50
To a large suburban house.

SOMEONE creeps toward the back of the house. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS127
01:14:21,00 --> 01:14:26,50
With a furrowed brow, SOMEONE turns and walks out. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS128
01:16:16,00 --> 01:16:20,50
She wipes a tear and heads off. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS129
01:16:19,00 --> 01:16:23,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE wait by the car. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS130
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:34,50
SOMEONE squints at her then unbuckles his seat belt. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS132
01:21:06,00 --> 01:21:10,50
SOMEONE's teeth clench. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS133
01:21:08,00 --> 01:21:12,50
Leaves with his middle finger raised. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS134
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:16,50
SOMEONE strains to regain her composure. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS135
01:21:23,00 --> 01:21:27,50
Now at Del's Saloon. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS136

KNOCKED_UP_DVS139
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:08,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS140
01:24:09,00 --> 01:24:15,50
SOMEONE shuts the door on him. Nighttime. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS141
01:27:03,00 --> 01:27:07,50
SOMEONE watches nervously. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS143
01:29:50,00 --> 01:29:54,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit on the curb. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS144

01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:13,50
SOMEONE sits on a bed. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS146
01:32:01,00 --> 01:32:04,50

01:35:37,00 --> 01:35:41,50
SOMEONE a gift. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS153
01:35:40,00 --> 01:35:46,50
Now standing away from the party SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS154
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:13,50
She glances over her shoulder. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS155
01:37:20,00 --> 01:37:26,50
SOMEONE holds a large castle cake with ice cream cone turrets. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS156
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:53,50
SOMEONE leaves. SOMEONE stares after him with a wounded gaze. Then walks out to the backyard. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS157
01:42:23,00 --> 01:42:27,50
SOMEONE clenches his jaw. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS158
01:42:37,00 --> 01:42:40,50
Sadie runs downstairs. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS159

KNOCKED_UP_DVS160
01:43:08,00 --> 01:43:14,50
She pauses thoughtfully and puts a hand on her belly. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS161
01:43:18,00 --> 01:43:23,50
SOMEONE reads What to Expect When You're Expecting. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS162

He picks up. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS163
01:44:17,00 --> 01:44:23,50
In her bedroom SOMEONE struggles to pack a suitcase without bending over.

He enters the main house. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS166
01:45:52,00 --> 01:45:57,50
He heads upstairs and strides down the hall. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS167
01:45:56,00 --> 01:46:04,50
SOMEONE's bed stands empty. He steps toward the bathroom. SOMEONE lounges in the tub covered in bubbles. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS168
01:46:23,00 --> 01:46:28,50
She lets her hands drift downward. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS169
01:46:56,00 --> 01:47:00,50
He paces in the hall. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS170
01:47:16,00 --> 01:47:20,50
SOMEONE pokes his head into the bathroom. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS171
01:48:24,00 --> 01:48:30,50
Hangs up and gazes off. Now he returns to the bathroom and sits on the edge of the tub. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS172
01:49:51,00 --> 01:49:55,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS173
01:50:56,00 --> 01:51:01,50
SOMEONE stares. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS174
01:51:17,00 --> 01:51:21,50
The tense doctor enters. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS175
01:51:55,00 --> 01:51:59,50
In the waiting room SOMEONE fidgets. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS176
01:52:28,00 --> 01:52:34,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE rubs SOMEONE's back. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS177
01:52:42,00 --> 01:52:46,50
Samuel strides in. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS178
01:53:06,00 --> 01:53:11,50
Between her legs and another on her belly. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS179
01:54:05,00 --> 01:54:09,50
In the hall, SOMEONE clutches his hand while talking. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS181
01:54:53,00 --> 01:55:01,50
SOMEONE lifts her head off the pillow as Dr. SOMEONE and SOMEONE return to her beside. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS182
01:55:15,00 --> 01:55:21,50
As Dr. SOMEONE leaves SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS183
01:56:05,00 --> 01:56:10,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in.. wheelchair. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS184
01:56:10,00 --> 01:56:15,50
He lowers his head to one side and taps his fingers on the armrest. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS185
01:56:24,00 --> 01:56:29,50
A passing doctor shakes his head at them. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS186
01:57:02,00 --> 01:57:07,50
In the hall SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS187
01:57:41,00 --> 01:57:48,50
As SOMEONE walks away, SOMEONE stares after him. Her mouth agape. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS188
01:57:46,00 --> 01:57:51,50
Now she mopes over to the waiting room and plops down beside SOMEONE. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS189
01:58:14,00 --> 01:58:19,50
Watching his wife, SOMEONE smirks. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS190
01:59:37,00 --> 01:59:41,50
In the delivery room. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS191
02:00:04,00 --> 02:00:08,50
He returns to the others. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS192
02:00:10,00 --> 02:00:15,50
Shakes his head and sits down. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS193
02:00:24,00 --> 02:00:28,50
SOMEONE winks. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS194
02:00:27,00 --> 02:00:31,50
SOMEONE's eye Shift between his wife and SOMEONE. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS195
02:03:09,00 --> 02:03:14,50
In a wheelchair. 

KNOCKED_UP_DVS196
02:03:12,00 --> 02:03:18,50
On car seat, mother watches her baby. SOMEONE drives. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS10
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:14,50
He unfastens his brace. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS11
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:18,50
In apparel with a trainee. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS12
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:13,50
It shows all team of executives. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS13
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:19,50
He points to a crown on his mug. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS14
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:48,50
SOMEONE glances from his white-mustached boss to a trio of younger executives. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS15
00:05:18,00 --> 00:05:24,50
The senior executive meets his gaze. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS16
00:05:31,00 --> 00:05:35,50
Man shows a ring. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS17
00:05:39,00 --> 00:05:44,50
Unfazed executive grins. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS18
00:06:05,00 --> 00:06:10,50
SOMEONE stares. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS19
00:06:35,00 --> 00:06:41,50
The beefy executive callously picks pizza out of his teeth. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS20
00:06:41,00 --> 00:06:47,50
Larry’s eyes glisten in a helpless stare. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS21
00:06:45,00 --> 00:06:52,50
The brown-faced executive spreads his hands. SOMEONE takes a breath 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS22
00:06:49,00 --> 00:06:59,50
to speak then swallows and looks away. Now traffic lines up behind SOMEONE as he drives his SUV with a stunned gaze. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS23
00:06:57,00 --> 00:07:21,50
A view with the left break light shows the SUV gliding into the driveway of a modest home with a well-manicured front lawn. Nighttime. A doorway on the opposite end of the cluttered room frames SOMEONE as he sits on the edge of his bed. Later he lies awake on his stomach, with one-half of his face against a pillow. Now on his back, he presses his hands to his face. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS24
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:38,50
An open doorway shows a glimpse of SOMEONE shoveling through the house. In an adjacent room a globe lamp glows softly. Standing in a closet of mostly empty hangers, SOMEONE hangs up his red U-Mart polo shirt. He stares at it for a moment, then slides the closet door shut. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS25
00:07:37,00 --> 00:07:41,50
Daytime. A series of phone calls. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS26
00:07:57,00 --> 00:08:16,50
SOMEONE flips his cellphone shut and rests this chin in his hand. Now at a bathroom sink he turns on the cold-water tap and bends over to splash his face. Later, he gazes worriedly into the mirror, as he blots his skin with a towel. Now he holds a pair of slacks on an ironing board. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS27
00:08:55,00 --> 00:09:01,50
Now he sits across from a banker with blond, feathered hair. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS28
00:09:26,00 --> 00:09:31,50
SOMEONE's chest heaves. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS29
00:09:41,00 --> 00:09:49,50
Now at home, SOMEONE hauls lawn chairs and a bag of golf clubs out to his front lawn. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS30
00:10:12,00 --> 00:10:16,50
SOMEONE puffs a pipe. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS31
00:10:58,00 --> 00:11:05,50
SOMEONE follows his neighbor into a garage filled with secondhand goods. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS32
00:11:18,00 --> 00:11:23,50
He hands SOMEONE a booklet. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS33
00:11:42,00 --> 00:11:46,50
Back in the present. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS34
00:12:05,00 --> 00:12:09,50
Entrance reads East Valley Community. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS35
00:12:18,00 --> 00:12:22,50
He looks at map and checks it, then. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS37
00:12:23,00 --> 00:12:27,50
Now at a registration desk he looks over a course book. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS38
00:12:25,00 --> 00:12:32,50
A silver haired man with a bowtie and a toothy smile approaches him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS39
00:13:14,00 --> 00:13:18,50
He points at the course book. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS40
00:13:27,00 --> 00:13:32,50
He gives a suggestive wink. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS41
00:13:43,00 --> 00:13:53,50
Camera bulb flashes and a student ID appears, featuring a photo of a puzzled-looking SOMEONE. Now at a gas station SOMEONE inspects the ID. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS42
00:13:51,00 --> 00:13:59,50
Gas tank pocketing his wallet, he eyes the pump’s display. As his gas cost ticks up past $60 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS43
00:14:01,00 --> 00:14:05,50
He fills his small tank. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS44
00:14:10,00 --> 00:14:15,50
SOMEONE’s total passes $70.00. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS45
00:14:14,00 --> 00:14:19,50
The scooter’s total is less than four. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS46
00:14:22,00 --> 00:14:26,50
The scooter’s meek. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS47
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:31,50
He wrenches the gas nozzle from his tank. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS48
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:38,50
SOMEONE approaches a scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS49
00:14:41,00 --> 00:14:46,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS50
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:26,50
Now SOMEONE carries over a flat screen TV. Later he straddles the scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS51
00:15:46,00 --> 00:15:51,50
He falters, half astride the scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS52
00:15:53,00 --> 00:15:57,50
Mill around outside East Valley Community College. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS53
00:15:56,00 --> 00:16:01,50
She pulls into a space in the parking lot. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS54
00:16:03,00 --> 00:16:10,50
Driver side door opens and a woman’s hand sets a pair of high heels on the ground. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS55
00:16:08,00 --> 00:16:12,50
Shapely foot slides into each high heels. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS56
00:16:11,00 --> 00:16:17,50
Owner an alluring woman with wavy auburn hair emerges. Wearing 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS57
00:16:22,00 --> 00:16:26,50
she trudges down a hall. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS58
00:16:28,00 --> 00:16:33,50
She enters her in her cluttered office reading the document. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS59
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:36,50
She sits at her desk, 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS60
00:16:36,00 --> 00:16:40,50
she brushes her hair out of her face. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS61
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:50,50
Then opens a drawer and takes out a pill. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS63
00:16:55,00 --> 00:17:03,50
She takes a weary breath. A full-figured raven-haired woman holding a to-go cup appears in her doorway. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS64
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:22,50
Her colleague enters an office across the hall. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS65
00:17:44,00 --> 00:17:49,50
Still sitting, she sips her drink. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS66
00:18:13,00 --> 00:18:17,50
The young woman grins. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS67
00:18:22,00 --> 00:18:27,50
Removing her helmet, she shakes out her curly hair. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS68
00:18:32,00 --> 00:18:37,50
SOMEONE eyes his belted khakis. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS69
00:18:44,00 --> 00:18:51,50
Now the auburn haired professor peeks in through a window in a classroom door. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS70
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:55,50
She enters and looks around. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS71
00:18:54,00 --> 00:18:59,50
She counts the meager number of students. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS72
00:18:58,00 --> 00:19:02,50
She checks again. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS73
00:19:14,00 --> 00:19:18,50
The students stare at her. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS74
00:19:23,00 --> 00:19:27,50
SOMEONE bursts in through another door. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS75
00:19:26,00 --> 00:19:33,50
The students follow his gaze to their professor, whose shoulders sag disappointedly. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS76
00:19:34,00 --> 00:19:38,50
Strides to the front of the class. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS77
00:19:45,00 --> 00:19:58,50
He watches from a front desk off to one side, as Professor SOMEONE sets down her back. The instructor gazes out at their expectant faces, then gives an indifferent shrug. She writes on a chalkboard in front of them. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS78
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:13,50
Breaks, she waves dismissively. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS79
00:20:29,00 --> 00:20:35,50
She gives a bright firm nod. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS80
00:20:38,00 --> 00:20:47,50
She eyes the students who shoot each other uneasy glances, then return their attention to their professor. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS81
00:20:57,00 --> 00:21:03,50
A young man with dark curly hair raises his hand. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS82
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:07,50
With a wry look she cocks her head. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS83
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:11,50
Her eyes narrow. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS84
00:21:13,00 --> 00:21:18,50
SOMEONE blinks apprehensively. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS85
00:21:30,00 --> 00:21:38,50
He smiles and nods. The other students shift their uneasy gazes to Miss SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS86
00:21:42,00 --> 00:21:49,50
SOMEONE half-smiles in SOMEONE’s direction but breaks off an urge to comment to him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS87
00:21:48,00 --> 00:21:53,50
He answers his cell. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS88
00:21:53,00 --> 00:21:58,50
Miss SOMEONE's jaw drops. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS89
00:21:58,00 --> 00:22:05,50
With a resolute nod she strides up to SOMEONE's desk and raps on it. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS90
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:23,50
He hangs up. As the professor leaves SOMEONE's desk, SOMEONE watches her alertly. Later, he hurries. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS91
00:22:30,00 --> 00:22:34,50
Seated at the end of one. He stops. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS92
00:22:43,00 --> 00:22:47,50
He sits beside her. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS93
00:23:15,00 --> 00:23:24,50
SOMEONE gives a puzzled frown, SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. Tilting her head she considers him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS94
00:23:25,00 --> 00:23:30,50
SOMEONE's brow crinkles. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS95
00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:37,50
She snags his cell. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS96
00:23:34,00 --> 00:23:39,50
She tosses its casing to. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS98
00:23:50,00 --> 00:23:54,50
He adjusts a mic. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS99
00:24:25,00 --> 00:24:31,50
He smiles. The students stare. His smile widens, 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS100
00:24:29,00 --> 00:24:34,50
he grins more broadly. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS101
00:24:37,00 --> 00:24:42,50
He lifts his brow at the unresponsive students. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS102
00:24:53,00 --> 00:25:01,50
Another classroom Miss SOMEONE writes care on a blackboard then faces two males and two females. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS103
00:25:01,00 --> 00:25:06,50
She gives a disappointed nod. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS104
00:25:06,00 --> 00:25:17,50
With her eyes averted, she grabs her bag off the table and strides to the back of the classroom. The students watch as the professor exits. Now in a computer 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS105
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:22,50
saw an image of a woman in her underwear. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS109
00:25:46,00 --> 00:25:53,50
She grabs two bottles from a liquor cabinet. Her high heels off, she dumps ice into a blender. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS110
00:25:52,00 --> 00:25:57,50
Scans his office. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS111
00:25:56,00 --> 00:26:01,50
He grabs a book and enters the kitchen. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS112
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:30,50
His wife indifferently sips her drink. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS113
00:26:28,00 --> 00:26:33,50
She lowers the cocktail. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS114
00:26:41,00 --> 00:26:46,50
She sits in an armchair. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS115
00:26:49,00 --> 00:26:53,50
Guilty frown. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS116
00:27:07,00 --> 00:27:11,50
He rolls his eyes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS117
00:27:10,00 --> 00:27:16,50
As he sits across from SOMEONE, she looks up from her magazine. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS118
00:27:33,00 --> 00:27:38,50
She takes two long swigs. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS119
00:27:36,00 --> 00:27:41,50
Closing her eyes, she leans forward. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS120
00:27:39,00 --> 00:27:45,50
She holds her brow. She winces. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS122
00:28:28,00 --> 00:28:35,50
SOMEONE meets his gaze. She opens her mouth to speak, then strides off. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS123
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:46,50
Escaping to a balcony, SOMEONE closes the sliding door and sits. Her husband wraps on the glass, his gaze intolerant. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS124
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:51,50
He cups his hands around his mouth. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS125
00:28:54,00 --> 00:29:02,50
Now in speech class a blond student hyperactively swivels a Lacrosse stick in her two-handed grip. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS126
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:36,50
SOMEONE shyly raises a hand. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS127
00:29:41,00 --> 00:29:52,50
SOMEONE squares a stack of notecards on his desk then rises from his seat. As he moves behind the lectern the dean smiles excitedly. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS128
00:29:50,00 --> 00:29:55,50
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS129
00:30:09,00 --> 00:30:14,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS130
00:30:21,00 --> 00:30:26,50
SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE checks his phone 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS131
00:30:25,00 --> 00:30:30,50
and picks lint of his shirt. He blinks nervously. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS132
00:30:30,00 --> 00:30:34,50
He checks his notes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS133
00:30:32,00 --> 00:30:38,50
As the dean gapes, SOMEONE narrows her eyes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS134
00:30:46,00 --> 00:30:51,50
As SOMEONE sits back down the dean grins. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS135
00:30:57,00 --> 00:31:02,50
SOMEONE heads to the podium. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS136
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:11,50
SOMEONE stares disbelievingly. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS137
00:31:11,00 --> 00:31:14,50
Into the mic. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS138
00:31:22,00 --> 00:31:27,50
Grinning he glances around at his classmates. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS139
00:31:38,00 --> 00:31:44,50
Lying on the floor with his toe and the other two back away. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS140
00:31:51,00 --> 00:31:59,50
He snaps as he steps from side to side repeatedly putting his feet apart then together. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS141
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:06,50
Legs bent, he swivels his knees in and out. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS143
00:32:17,00 --> 00:32:23,50
Hovers on the movie screen, asking, Scoot? 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS144
00:32:25,00 --> 00:32:29,50

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS146

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS147
00:32:33,00 --> 00:32:37,50
riding a scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS148
00:32:41,00 --> 00:32:46,50
Professor SOMEONE glares. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS149
00:32:46,00 --> 00:32:51,50
He stands in front of SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS150
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:57,50
SOMEONE closes his cell and places it in the professor's hand. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS151
00:33:00,00 --> 00:33:04,50
As he walks off, SOMEONE 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS152
00:33:04,00 --> 00:33:08,50
to SOMEONE, who winces. Later. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS153
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:17,50
SOMEONE reverts his gaze as she 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS154
00:33:22,00 --> 00:33:26,50

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS155
00:33:29,00 --> 00:33:33,50
SOMEONE locks his menacing. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS156
00:35:48,00 --> 00:35:52,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS157
00:37:03,00 --> 00:37:07,50
Hurries over. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS158
00:37:16,00 --> 00:37:21,50
SOMEONE heads home. A scruffy friend studies a 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS159
00:37:29,00 --> 00:37:33,50
while he searches a rack of clothes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS160
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:36,50
Her pair of shorts. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS161
00:37:51,00 --> 00:38:02,50
In SOMEONE's house, the middle-aged student highlights almost every line on a textbook's pages. Seated at his kitchen island he looks to the front door and doffs his glasses. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS162
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:05,50
SOMEONE enters with a blonde friend. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS163
00:38:30,00 --> 00:38:34,50
SOMEONE gets up. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS164
00:38:42,00 --> 00:38:48,50
Later Sal cuts SOMEONE's hair in the bathroom. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS165
00:38:52,00 --> 00:38:56,50
His friends redecorate. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS166
00:39:00,00 --> 00:39:08,50
SOMEONE shrugs. Later SOMEONE drapes a silk scarf over a lamp. In the now smartly arranged living room, 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS167
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:10,50
SOMEONE and a friend read. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS168
00:39:09,00 --> 00:39:15,50
Sal introduces SOMEONE. He sports a hip close-cropped haircut. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS169
00:39:19,00 --> 00:39:24,50
SOMEONE eyes the made over room. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS170
00:39:23,00 --> 00:39:27,50
SOMEONE complies. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS171
00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:44,50
SOMEONE gives him a kiss. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS172
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:48,50
She follows the others out. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS173
00:39:51,00 --> 00:39:57,50
He peeks through his window blinds, then turns. SOMEONE faces him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS174
00:40:08,00 --> 00:40:12,50
SOMEONE nods. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS175
00:40:21,00 --> 00:40:25,50
SOMEONE makes eye contact. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS176
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:31,50
Nodding, SOMEONE swallows. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS177
00:40:31,00 --> 00:40:35,50
They stack their left hands on top. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS178
00:40:39,00 --> 00:40:53,50
SOMEONE's look goes from smiley to severe in a split second. He leaves. SOMEONE smoothes his new do, rubbing the sides forward and padding down the back. He views his handsome living room. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS179
00:41:14,00 --> 00:41:19,50
Lamar bites down on his pipe. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS180
00:41:37,00 --> 00:41:41,50
SOMEONE sees SOMEONE watching. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS181
00:42:50,00 --> 00:42:56,50
She raises her window. Later in class. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS182
00:43:09,00 --> 00:43:17,50
SOMEONE doffs his glasses and beams. He sees the female Lacrosse player watching his googly eyed response. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS183
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:22,50
SOMEONE eyes his professor. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS184
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:27,50
He winks at her. SOMEONE eyes him flatly, then looks to her right. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS185
00:43:30,00 --> 00:43:34,50
Talk about dance steps sleeps. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS186
00:43:32,00 --> 00:43:37,50
An eraser hits him and he jolts awake. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS187
00:43:42,00 --> 00:43:47,50
She regards SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS188
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:55,50
His smile wilts and he nervously glances aside. SOMEONE looks to the center. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS189
00:44:07,00 --> 00:44:11,50
SOMEONE points. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS190
00:44:14,00 --> 00:44:19,50
SOMEONE frowns studiously. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS191
00:44:33,00 --> 00:44:38,50
At Talia's photo, teacher's pet. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS192
00:44:37,00 --> 00:44:42,50
I read the course pad. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS193
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:56,50
The professor's hand reaches out. SOMEONE flips his cellphone shut and hands it over. Standing over him, SOMEONE angrily shakes the phone. Now at a storage facility. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS194
00:45:45,00 --> 00:45:53,50
SOMEONE bends over, his cotton-clad rear inadvertently mooning SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS195
00:45:50,00 --> 00:45:56,50
Takes off his shades and glares at SOMEONE. She shrugs then drapes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS196
00:45:57,00 --> 00:46:02,50
SOMEONE waggles his bottoms into the pants. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS197
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:05,50
Puts his shades back on. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS198
00:46:04,00 --> 00:46:11,50
Now SOMEONE's scooter sits parked outside of SOMEONE's Restaurant. Inside, he pours coffee for group of older men. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS199
00:46:11,00 --> 00:46:17,50
men playing cards. He sets down the pot and sits by SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS200
00:46:29,00 --> 00:46:33,50
SOMEONE eyes him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS201
00:46:32,00 --> 00:46:36,50
He doffs his glasses. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS202
00:47:00,00 --> 00:47:03,50
Carlos resumes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS203
00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:09,50
Raul nods grimly. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS204
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:16,50
Now SOMEONE cracks an egg. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS205
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:44,50
SOMEONE shakes SOMEONE's hand. Now in class. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS206
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:12,50
The students look over their shoulders. SOMEONE wears vampire fangs. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS207
00:48:28,00 --> 00:48:33,50
SOMEONE hangs his head, SOMEONE wipes her brow. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS208
00:48:33,00 --> 00:48:38,50
His chest. Now our view follow SOMEONE as he weaves through traffic o0n his blue scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS209
00:48:58,00 --> 00:49:02,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS210
00:49:11,00 --> 00:49:18,50
SOMEONE hands over his cell. Later he talks with to the professor outside. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS211
00:49:29,00 --> 00:49:34,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS212
00:49:40,00 --> 00:49:46,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch her go. SOMEONE low 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS213
00:49:50,00 --> 00:49:54,50
parked outside donut prince.  

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS214
00:49:52,00 --> 00:49:58,50
SOMEONE sits in the car with a pen and a slip of paper. Rain trickles down. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS215
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:07,50
The square of paper aside and grabs another. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS216
00:50:05,00 --> 00:50:10,50
An SUV parks in front of her car. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS217
00:50:13,00 --> 00:50:17,50
SOMEONE drinks from her travel cup. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS218
00:50:15,00 --> 00:50:24,50
Peering ahead, she notices something and sets the cup back down. She gawks as SOMEONE and SOMEONE leave the SUV for the donut shop. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS219
00:50:28,00 --> 00:50:35,50
Windshield wipers swish before her view of the duo closing their umbrellas and entering. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS220
00:50:36,00 --> 00:50:40,50
She feeds SOMEONE a bite. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS221
00:50:45,00 --> 00:50:50,50
They return to SOMEONE's SUV. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS222
00:50:54,00 --> 00:51:01,50
Later, SOMEONE enters the classroom wearing a tasseled scarf. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS223
00:51:05,00 --> 00:51:09,50
SOMEONE enters. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS224
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:14,50
SOMEONE enters. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS225
00:51:15,00 --> 00:51:20,50
As SOMEONE enters, SOMEONE adjusts the podium. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS226
00:51:22,00 --> 00:51:31,50
She puts down a box then crosses to her desk at the back of the room. SOMEONE draws a paper slip from the box. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS227
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:42,50
SOMEONE heads for the podium. SOMEONE seated at the desk and checks her watch. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS228
00:51:42,00 --> 00:51:50,50
SOMEONE looks up at a clock, which reads two minutes to eight. He scans his fellow students. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS229
00:51:50,00 --> 00:51:55,50
He fidgets with the paper slip. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS230
00:52:06,00 --> 00:52:10,50
SOMEONE glares. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS232
00:54:27,00 --> 00:54:32,50
She gives him a trendy dark rimmed pair. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS233
00:54:41,00 --> 00:54:47,50
She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him on the cheek. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS234
00:54:48,00 --> 00:54:54,50
SOMEONE takes a seat opposite them. SOMEONE regards him uneasily. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS235
00:54:52,00 --> 00:54:57,50
SOMEONE glares. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS236
00:55:22,00 --> 00:55:30,50
Later, SOMEONE rides glumly as her husband drives. A dessert box sits on the dashboard. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS237
00:56:17,00 --> 00:56:22,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes at him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS238
00:56:28,00 --> 00:56:34,50
SOMEONE stares ahead, her jaw hanging open. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS239
00:57:14,00 --> 00:57:26,50
She picks up a fistful of pebbles from a tree planter, hurls them after the departing car, then staggers off. Now she sits cross-legged on a bus stop bench in front of a row of dark 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS240
00:57:26,00 --> 00:57:30,50
with the flow of traffic the street 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS241
00:58:06,00 --> 00:58:11,50
SOMEONE sneers at her. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS243
00:58:38,00 --> 00:58:41,50
She puts on her high heeled pumps. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS244
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:43,50
She stands. SOMEONE frowns. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS245
00:58:43,00 --> 00:58:47,50
She looks at him with a withering gaze. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS246
00:58:49,00 --> 00:58:53,50
He Drags his lips in an affable 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS247

To the landing outside her apartment. Turning she finds SOMEONE behind her. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS250
01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:37,50
She looks around. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS251
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:43,50
SOMEONE searches a potted plant. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS252
01:00:48,00 --> 01:00:53,50
She examines her door locks. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS253
01:00:57,00 --> 01:01:02,50
In between SOMEONE and the door SOMEONE unlocks it. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS254
01:01:17,00 --> 01:01:24,50
SOMEONE returns the key tin to its pot, then keeps his back to SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS255
01:01:29,00 --> 01:01:35,50
SOMEONE's brow furrows as he listens. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS256
01:01:33,00 --> 01:01:37,50
He rolls his eyes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS257
01:01:36,00 --> 01:01:41,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS258
01:01:42,00 --> 01:01:48,50
Facing her, SOMEONE takes in her drunken grin. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS259
01:01:49,00 --> 01:01:53,50
She shows her ring. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS260
01:02:08,00 --> 01:02:14,50
She smiles through half closed eyes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS261
01:02:21,00 --> 01:02:25,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS262
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:55,50
SOMEONE gives him a playful grin and SOMEONE stares at her with concerned eyes. She sways slightly, her hands joint beneath her chin and her gaze softens. As she grabs him, SOMEONE wraps his arms around her waist. They kiss. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS263
01:03:00,00 --> 01:03:04,50
Her off her feet and she slaps. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS266

He raps against the trunk, the cab pulls away. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS271
01:05:01,00 --> 01:05:07,50
Cheesecake drips from the takeout box in his hand. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS272
01:05:06,00 --> 01:05:12,50
He lumbers on to the sidewalk and approaches the apartment building. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS273
01:05:12,00 --> 01:05:24,50
On the landing, he finds the contents of his home office. Multiple copies of the same book sit in stacks around his computer, which displays a porn site. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS274
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:34,50
Box and it splatters against the door. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS275
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:38,50
In class SOMEONE wears sunglasses. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS276
01:06:18,00 --> 01:06:23,50
Grabbing a skateboard, SOMEONE smirks at SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS277
01:06:21,00 --> 01:06:34,50
The middle-aged student gathers his things and makes his way towards SOMEONE's table at the back of the room. She sits stiffly, her large dark sunglasses masking most of her expression. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS278
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:39,50
SOMEONE offers a tender smile. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS279
01:06:51,00 --> 01:06:56,50
SOMEONE's hopeful smile fades. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS280
01:06:58,00 --> 01:07:04,50
SOMEONE's brow knits in a wounded look. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS281
01:07:08,00 --> 01:07:12,50
She gazes off. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS282
01:07:11,00 --> 01:07:17,50
She gives a brisk headshake then returns her attention to SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS283
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:52,50
With his lips pressed in a solemn line SOMEONE gives a respectful nod. SOMEONE's chin twitches as she firmly returns the gesture. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS284
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:00,50
As he turns away, SOMEONE's shoulders sag. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS285
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:23,50
Chain swings from SOMEONE's pocket as he pulls his bag over his shoulder. Sitting motionless, the teacher gazes after him, then bows her head as he exits. Now at home, SOMEONE packs papers into a large accordion file. He places a checkmark on the last line of a list. Picking up a key, he eyes a handwritten tag tied to it with string, then throws it in the file. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS286
01:08:22,00 --> 01:08:27,50
He rides his scooter down a street. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS287

He gives her the accordion files. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS288
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:17,50
With a triumphant smirk he turns on his heel and strides out of the bank. Now at the yard sale, he smokes a pipe with Lamar. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS289
01:09:41,00 --> 01:09:46,50
SOMEONE gives him a thoughtful look.

A mother and daughter arrive with a measuring tape. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS291
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:13,50
While lying in bed, SOMEONE wipes a tear from the corner of her eye. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS292
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:25,50
Still in her pajamas, she opens a windows blinds. As she peers outside, falling 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS293
01:10:23,00 --> 01:10:28,50
rain reflects against the glass. Lingering by the window 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS294
01:10:27,00 --> 01:10:37,50
from a mug. Now in class she walks among her students with a box of folded slips of paper. Each student draws one. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS295
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:52,50

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS298
01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:26,50
SOMEONE strolls up to the podium and sets the cardboard box on top. Her students gather there. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS299
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:30,50
Picking up a notebook, she heads to the back of the classroom. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS300
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:36,50
SOMEONE removes his reading glasses, then gazes after her. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS301
01:11:37,00 --> 01:11:44,50
He follows the other students out. Now SOMEONE walks down the hall to her office. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS302
01:12:08,00 --> 01:12:12,50
SOMEONE gapes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS303

01:12:25,00 --> 01:12:30,50
SOMEONE enters her office. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS306
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:39,50
Now in Economics. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS307
01:12:44,00 --> 01:12:48,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS308
01:12:51,00 --> 01:12:56,50
SOMEONE stands his class. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS309
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:07,50
He regards his sober students with wide eyes. SOMEONE taps his pen. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS310
01:13:29,00 --> 01:13:34,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS311
01:13:53,00 --> 01:13:57,50
She shows her lower back. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS312
01:13:58,00 --> 01:14:05,50
SOMEONE touches it. Watching them, SOMEONE knocks on the window. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS313
01:14:06,00 --> 01:14:11,50
He throws up his hand and turns away. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS314
01:14:17,00 --> 01:14:22,50
He gets on his scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS315
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:38,50
Now in the kitchen at SOMEONE's, SOMEONE transfers a grilled sandwich on to a plate, garnishes the meal and sets the order on a pickup or a paperback.  

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS316
01:14:37,00 --> 01:14:44,50
He highlights a passage near the end. Now a view through 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS317

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS320
01:14:58,00 --> 01:15:03,50
His scooter's headlights briefly illuminates red-striped diagonally across the sign. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS322
01:15:11,00 --> 01:15:16,50

He sweeps his gaze over the surrounding neighborhood. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS325
01:15:28,00 --> 01:15:35,50
The idyllic tranquil moment, then turns away and grimly heads inside. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS327
01:15:45,00 --> 01:16:00,50
He looks at the now empty house, then exits, shutting the door beside him. Outside Lamar sits on SOMEONE's sofa, which rests on the front lawn among his other belongings. SOMEONE brings SOMEONE his box. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS328
01:16:03,00 --> 01:16:08,50
SOMEONE works on a car.

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS333
01:16:50,00 --> 01:16:54,50
SOMEONE averts his gaze. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS334
01:16:52,00 --> 01:16:57,50
He reaches into his pocket. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS335
01:17:30,00 --> 01:17:36,50
Lamar gives him three lottery tickets. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS336
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:44,50
Two kids ride past them. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS337
01:17:58,00 --> 01:18:02,50
SOMEONE disappear as SOMEONE follow. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS341
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:07,50

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS342
01:19:30,00 --> 01:19:34,50
SOMEONE smirks. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS343
01:19:34,00 --> 01:19:38,50

Joins SOMEONE on the walkway. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS349
01:20:33,00 --> 01:20:38,50

He meets SOMEONE's gaze, she grins broadly in reply. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS356
01:25:27,00 --> 01:25:48,50
Later in economics, Professor SOMEONE watches his students from his desk. He caps a thermos then sets it near a collection of cellphones and sips from the thermos cup. Sitting at the long tables, the econ students diligently work on their exams. SOMEONE stands. He collects his bag and papers and makes his way to the professor's desk. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS357
01:25:57,00 --> 01:26:02,50
He returns SOMEONE's smart phone. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS358
01:26:01,00 --> 01:26:07,50
As SOMEONE heads out of the lecture hall the professor lifts his thermos. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS360
01:26:18,00 --> 01:26:22,50
Taking a sip, she stares to SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS361
01:26:29,00 --> 01:26:33,50
SOMEONE comma SOMEONE, a cursor blinks beside an A. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS362
01:26:33,00 --> 01:26:38,50
SOMEONE considers, then adds a plus. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS363
01:26:40,00 --> 01:26:45,50
She briefly touches her flushed cheeks. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS364
01:26:47,00 --> 01:26:52,50
SOMEONE enters following her raven haired 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS365

SOMEONE notices her. SOMEONE glances at him with a smile. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS366
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:03,50
Who shares a booth with SOMEONE spots SOMEONE too. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS367
01:27:18,00 --> 01:27:23,50
SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE's booth. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS368
01:27:57,00 --> 01:28:02,50
SOMEONE smiles at her. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS369
01:28:08,00 --> 01:28:12,50
She smiles sincerely. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS370
01:28:12,00 --> 01:28:18,50
As SOMEONE heads away, SOMEONE turns back to her friend. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS371
01:28:20,00 --> 01:28:25,50
SOMEONE glances out the window. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS372
01:29:12,00 --> 01:29:17,50
He sits among the greatly diminished headcount. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS373
01:29:26,00 --> 01:29:37,50
Bored elsewhere, SOMEONE finishes writing the word care next to her course title. English 40, Shakespeare the Politician. She faces a handful of students. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS374
01:29:46,00 --> 01:29:50,50
Door in the back opens. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS375
01:29:50,00 --> 01:29:56,50
She smiles as SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the Lacrosse player hurry in. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS376
01:30:02,00 --> 01:30:07,50
SOMEONE subdues a delighted smile. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS377
01:30:11,00 --> 01:30:16,50
SOMEONE slaps his forehead. SOMEONE glances at his friends then slumps in his seat, as SOMEONE distributes a handout. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS378
01:30:24,00 --> 01:30:36,50
Later the auburn haired professor walks down the narrow corridor toward her office. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS382
01:30:45,00 --> 01:30:55,50
Horton number seven. A doodled black crown marks the bottom as his signature. Closing her eyes, SOMEONE gives a wide 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS383
01:30:53,00 --> 01:30:57,50
She slips the note off the bin. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS384
01:30:58,00 --> 01:31:04,50
Displays an arrow moving along the map as she drives. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS13
00:03:13,00 --> 00:03:18,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a bemused frown. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS14
00:04:28,00 --> 00:04:32,50
Muffled click. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS15
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:04,50
In the ward, a male nurse tends to a burly patient on his side. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS16
00:06:11,00 --> 00:06:15,50
SOMEONE's gloved hand twist the tube. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS17
00:06:24,00 --> 00:06:28,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS18
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:31,50
Where SOMEONE and SOMEONE sanitize their hands. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS19
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:06,50
They bump fists. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS20
00:07:09,00 --> 00:07:41,50
Now at the SOMEONE' two-story colonial, a red family crest hangs in SOMEONE's basement layer. It reads, Certavi et Vici Byrnes. A framed photo shows SOMEONE with a Bedouin, dressed as a Bedouin. In another, he shoulder-to-shoulder with President SOMEONE W. Bush. Sepia-toned photo shows dates, men, and officers resembling SOMEONE. A shelf holds books on genealogy. On a bulletin board, headshots form a smartly right-angled family tree. SOMEONE frowns at photos of Deborah Banks and Dr. Robert Banks. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS21
00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:48,50
He takes down Robert's photo. Now in their bedroom, SOMEONE packs a suitcase. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS22
00:08:24,00 --> 00:08:29,50
Holds his chest but quickly smiles. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS23
00:08:44,00 --> 00:08:51,50
Now as SOMEONE drives, his cell reads incoming call. Mom Focker.  

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS24
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:55,50
On a studio. The Bohemian mother talks on the phone. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS25
00:11:05,00 --> 00:11:12,50
SOMEONE tosses earpiece aside. In his layer, SOMEONE honkers at his desk. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS26
00:11:10,00 --> 00:11:28,50
Using an X-ACTO knife, he neatly cuts a wedding picture of Dr. SOMEONE and SOMEONE down the middle. He folds Dr. SOMEONE's half, tears it in two, and shoves it in a wastebasket. Eyeing SOMEONE's photo, the ex-CIA agent rubs his chest. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS27
00:11:27,00 --> 00:11:33,50
He places two fingers alongside his carotid. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS28
00:11:32,00 --> 00:11:40,50
As his Siamese cat eyes him from a footstool, SOMEONE dials his cellphone. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS29
00:11:53,00 --> 00:12:00,50
SOMEONE turns on his polygraph machine then tears open his button down. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS31
00:12:02,00 --> 00:12:06,50
The cat observes. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS32
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:51,50
SOMEONE Skypes them from a yacht. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS33
00:13:31,00 --> 00:13:36,50
Bikini clog beauty approaches SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS34
00:13:44,00 --> 00:13:48,50
Nuzzling and kissing him. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS35
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:07,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE give the departing hottie a playful smack on the rear. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS36
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:23,50
SOMEONE's lasagna. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS37
00:15:59,00 --> 00:16:03,50
SOMEONE glances at his family. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS38
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:18,50
He enters a bedroom. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS39
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:21,50
SOMEONE swivels in his chair. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS40
00:17:44,00 --> 00:17:49,50
SOMEONE lifts his brow. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS41
00:18:13,00 --> 00:18:18,50
He points to a photo of SOMEONE on the family tree. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS42
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:45,50
SOMEONE shifts his thoughtful gaze. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS43
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:48,50
We view him through window blinds. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS44
00:18:51,00 --> 00:18:56,50
He stares unflinchingly. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS45
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:21,50
Gazing out the window, SOMEONE lowers his phone. With a strange smile, he strolls back into the kitchen where SOMEONE looks over. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS46
00:19:22,00 --> 00:19:26,50
He lifts her brow. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS47
00:19:38,00 --> 00:19:42,50
SOMEONE eyes his daughter. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS48
00:19:41,00 --> 00:19:48,50
Chewing her food, she turns away. SOMEONE shifts his gaze to his son, SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS49
00:19:46,00 --> 00:19:50,50
He looks up. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS50
00:19:49,00 --> 00:19:56,50
With a calm look, SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE, his hands folded. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS51
00:20:02,00 --> 00:20:06,50
SOMEONE holds up quieting fingers. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS52
00:20:04,00 --> 00:20:08,50
SOMEONE closes her mouth. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS53
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:16,50
He eyes him firmly. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS54
00:20:15,00 --> 00:20:19,50
SOMEONE takes a small bite. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS55
00:20:18,00 --> 00:20:24,50
As SOMEONE gives a satisfied look, SOMEONE vomits. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS56
00:20:26,00 --> 00:20:30,50
Daytime, puffy clouds. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS59
00:20:58,00 --> 00:21:05,50
Its window, he opens it then jogs across the street to the SOMEONE' car. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS60
00:21:20,00 --> 00:21:28,50
With one hand on SOMEONE's waist and the other on his neck, SOMEONE kisses both of the older man's cheeks. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS61
00:21:38,00 --> 00:21:44,50
He slaps his hands to SOMEONE's face and kisses him again. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS62
00:21:42,00 --> 00:21:47,50
Later at the dinner table. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS63
00:22:11,00 --> 00:22:15,50
SOMEONE picks up his glass. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS64
00:22:34,00 --> 00:22:39,50
He winks at SOMEONE then leaves. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS65
00:23:32,00 --> 00:23:37,50
He takes it out. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS66
00:23:51,00 --> 00:23:56,50
SOMEONE's smile disappears. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS67
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:20,50
As he carves, SOMEONE peeks over the table. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS68
00:24:25,00 --> 00:24:30,50
SOMEONE winces as SOMEONE mangles the bird. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS70
00:25:30,00 --> 00:25:37,50
SOMEONE takes his hand. SOMEONE places his other one over it. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS71
00:25:40,00 --> 00:25:44,50
SOMEONE gazes at her. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS72
00:26:09,00 --> 00:26:14,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE turn to SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS73
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:43,50
He squeezes the back of SOMEONE's neck and the boy goes limp, his eyes closed. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS74
00:26:46,00 --> 00:26:51,50
He sets him on the couch. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS75
00:28:29,00 --> 00:28:34,50
SOMEONE sets a hand on SOMEONE's other shoulder. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS76
00:28:36,00 --> 00:28:41,50
They both pat his face. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS77
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:46,50
Morning, SOMEONE feels SOMEONE's flushed brow as she lies in bed. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS78
00:29:01,00 --> 00:29:06,50
He and SOMEONE drive into the city. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS79
00:29:48,00 --> 00:29:53,50
SOMEONE rumples his lips into a frown. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS80
00:30:34,00 --> 00:30:39,50
SOMEONE's face hardens. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS81
00:30:38,00 --> 00:30:51,50
Now, a handful of children play in the courtyard of a glass-paneled building. Inside an auditorium, a blonde woman grins at the audience as she strolls on stage. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS82
00:30:54,00 --> 00:30:58,50
A slide show starts. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS83
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:03,50
A photo shows surgeons. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS84
00:31:20,00 --> 00:31:25,50
Children sketch a shirtless model. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS85
00:31:42,00 --> 00:31:48,50
In the courtyard, young children in cheerleading uniforms do backflip. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS86
00:32:19,00 --> 00:32:24,50
They give confused looks. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS87
00:32:56,00 --> 00:33:01,50
Their smiles fade. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS88
00:33:49,00 --> 00:34:00,50
Later, they pull up to the new house where some construction workers take a break in the yard. A dump truck of sand sits in the driveway. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS89
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:10,50
An orange sports car zooms past 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS90
00:34:07,00 --> 00:34:15,50
Then swings into a U-turn and parks behind SOMEONE's car. SOMEONE climbs out. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS91
00:37:00,00 --> 00:37:04,50
He hops at the bottom of the drive. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS92
00:37:06,00 --> 00:37:12,50
He hits door, sand cascades onto SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS93
00:37:10,00 --> 00:37:14,50
SOMEONE race over. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS94
00:37:25,00 --> 00:37:29,50
He supports SOMEONE's head. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS95
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:37,50
SOMEONE glares. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS96
00:37:35,00 --> 00:37:39,50
Later, SOMEONE swabs his ears. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS97
00:38:38,00 --> 00:38:42,50
SOMEONE touches his cheek. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS98
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:47,50
SOMEONE returns to the phone. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS99
00:40:12,00 --> 00:40:17,50
SOMEONE listens from under the bed. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS100
00:40:15,00 --> 00:40:23,50
Later, SOMEONE sits with her as she pretends to shoot green toy soldiers with tan ones. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS101
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:50,50
SOMEONE nods. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS102
00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:07,50
SOMEONE's eyes shift. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS103
00:41:10,00 --> 00:41:15,50
Later, SOMEONE arrives at home. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS104
00:41:27,00 --> 00:41:31,50
Sees SOMEONE stow a bag in a closet. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS105
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:26,50
As SOMEONE hurries down the hall, SOMEONE glares after him. On a table, SOMEONE's phone vibrates. Turning to it, SOMEONE reads a text from SOMEONE, Can't wait to see you at the hotel tonight. Later SOMEONE walks outside, his briefcase clutched in one hand. SOMEONE sneaks after him, disguised in a windbreaker and bucket hat. As SOMEONE glances back, his father-in-law steps into some shadows. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS107
00:42:33,00 --> 00:42:37,50
SOMEONE peers back around the corner. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS112
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:24,50
Frowning, SOMEONE sticks his head outside and glances up and down the platform. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS115
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:41,50
Door to SOMEONE's train car, SOMEONE steps inside. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS116
00:43:45,00 --> 00:43:49,50
SOMEONE appears behind him. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS117
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:51,50
Turns around. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS118
00:44:13,00 --> 00:44:19,50
He stares at SOMEONE, who gives a halfhearted smile. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS121
00:44:57,00 --> 00:45:02,50
They enter a convention room. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS122
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:25,50
Narrowing his eyes, SOMEONE shifts them mischievously. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS123
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:36,50
At the apartment, SOMEONE turns on a light in the coat closet. He crouches then inspects SOMEONE's hidden bag. With a furrowed brow, he finds pamphlets for Sustengo then removes a sample box. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS124
00:45:34,00 --> 00:45:42,50
As he reads it, SOMEONE creeps up behind him wearing a trench coat over a negligee. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS125
00:45:54,00 --> 00:45:58,50
She kisses his cheek. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS126
00:46:06,00 --> 00:46:11,50
She unzips his jacket and he frowns. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS127
00:46:39,00 --> 00:46:51,50
She kisses her finger then blows him the kiss. As she leaves, SOMEONE eyes the sample box of Sustengo. Now at a bar, three doctors approach SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS128
00:47:14,00 --> 00:47:18,50
He strolls over. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS129
00:48:18,00 --> 00:48:23,50
He wanders over to the bar. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS130
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:08,50
SOMEONE lifts his gaze to SOMEONE's face. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS131
00:49:30,00 --> 00:49:39,50
SOMEONE gives a nod and SOMEONE looks away. Later, SOMEONE opens the apartment door and steps into the dark living room. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS132
00:49:38,00 --> 00:49:47,50
As he slides off his coat, a lamp shines its light on him. SOMEONE sits in an armchair beside it. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS133
00:49:45,00 --> 00:49:49,50
SOMEONE shields his eyes. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS134
00:49:51,00 --> 00:49:57,50
SOMEONE holds up the box of Sustengo. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS135
00:50:01,00 --> 00:50:05,50
SOMEONE brightens the light. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS136
00:50:09,00 --> 00:50:14,50
SOMEONE hangs up his coat. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS137
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:28,50
As SOMEONE rises, SOMEONE stops and turns to him. He points to SOMEONE's crotch. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS138
00:50:39,00 --> 00:50:43,50
SOMEONE steps closer. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS139
00:51:27,00 --> 00:51:34,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE pulls on Latex gloves then opens the needle and syringe. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS140
00:51:32,00 --> 00:51:37,50
He gestures at the bulge in SOMEONE's pants. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS141
00:51:52,00 --> 00:51:57,50
His shoulders heave as he reaches toward SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS142
00:51:59,00 --> 00:52:06,50
As he readies the needle, two slippered feet walk down the hall. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS143
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:08,50
SOMEONE heads to the bathroom. He holds the knob. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS145
00:52:16,00 --> 00:52:22,50
He congests himself as he walks down the hall toward SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS146
00:52:33,00 --> 00:52:41,50
He gives two thumbs up then heads away. SOMEONE looks at her mother and winces. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS147
00:52:42,00 --> 00:52:47,50
Now, SOMEONE tucks SOMEONE in. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS148
00:53:16,00 --> 00:53:22,50
SOMEONE lets SOMEONE shut the door then enters anyway. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS149
00:53:24,00 --> 00:53:29,50
SOMEONE stands by. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS150
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:41,50
SOMEONE glowers. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS151
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:04,50
Later in the hallway, SOMEONE gently shuts SOMEONE's door. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS152
00:54:21,00 --> 00:54:31,50
Without breaking eye contact, the two men circle. SOMEONE gives a mock scowl. He and SOMEONE back away from each other. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS153
00:54:30,00 --> 00:54:41,50
SOMEONE tauntingly shrugs his hands apart. SOMEONE does the same. SOMEONE repeats the gesture. Then they go their separate ways. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS154
00:54:39,00 --> 00:54:47,50
Daytime, SOMEONE peers out the cracked open door of the guest bedroom while on his cell. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS155
00:55:04,00 --> 00:55:08,50
He glances back. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS156
00:55:32,00 --> 00:56:04,50
Later at a computer, SOMEONE types A-N-D-I-G-A-R-C-I-A into the Google search field and gets back image results and links for the handsome dark-haired actor. He adds the keyword, Chicago and finds a link to a Myspace profile. Leaning in, SOMEONE opens the zebra print page then scrolls down to find the photo of SOMEONE kissing SOMEONE on the cheek. The retired CIA man reads the caption, "Crazy night at the Hilton." He minimizes the page as SOMEONE enters. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS158
00:56:22,00 --> 00:56:29,50
SOMEONE joins the rest of the family. SOMEONE checks his watch. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS159
00:56:29,00 --> 00:56:33,50
SOMEONE gives them a kiss. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS161
00:56:52,00 --> 00:56:57,50
The vehicles park and they step out. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS162
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:34,50
SOMEONE lifts his shirt to reveal his lower back. The other study a large tattoo of SOMEONE's smiling face above the banner, forever. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS163
00:58:07,00 --> 00:58:11,50
It's only half of SOMEONE's face. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS164
00:58:28,00 --> 00:58:33,50
Later in SOMEONE's office. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS165
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:03,50
They swap an icy look. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS166
00:59:07,00 --> 00:59:12,50
Now, SOMEONE sits in an easel. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS167
00:59:10,00 --> 00:59:15,50
The family watches behind a mirrored window. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS168
00:59:20,00 --> 00:59:25,50
She shows SOMEONE a phony eye chart. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS169
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:37,50
SOMEONE starts the timer. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS170
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:53,50
Back at the easel. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS171
00:59:53,00 --> 00:59:57,50
SOMEONE recoils. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS172
00:59:55,00 --> 01:00:01,50
A stick figure holds a syringe to another's penis. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS173
01:00:13,00 --> 01:00:20,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS174
01:00:37,00 --> 01:00:41,50
SOMEONE smiles proudly toward the mirrored window. SOMEONE gapes. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS176
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:42,50
On the playground. They spot a surveillance camera. The boy glares at his dad. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS179
01:02:50,00 --> 01:02:54,50
SOMEONE beams. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS180
01:03:15,00 --> 01:03:20,50
Now, SOMEONE approaches the nurses' station. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS181
01:03:28,00 --> 01:03:32,50
SOMEONE pulls him aside. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS183
01:08:16,00 --> 01:08:20,50
Back in the hall. SOMEONE emerges. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS184
01:08:20,00 --> 01:08:26,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE, who holds an arm around SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS185
01:08:24,00 --> 01:08:29,50
SOMEONE presses the elevator button. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS188
01:08:56,00 --> 01:09:00,50
He park at the new house's driveway. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS190
01:09:34,00 --> 01:09:41,50
She leaves and SOMEONE stares ahead. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS191
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:50,50
Now in the new house, SOMEONE stands alone in the middle of an unfinished room. SOMEONE turns away from a three-foot hole in the wall and crosses to the front door, where he finds SOMEONE with a bottle of wine. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS198
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:59,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE's car arrives out front. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS199
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:04,50
The retired CIA agent gets out and marches gravely toward the house. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS200
01:12:02,00 --> 01:12:11,50
Glancing aside, he pauses and stares. His flashlight beam hits the license plate of SOMEONE's convertible. It reads, "RX GRRRL." 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS201
01:12:09,00 --> 01:12:15,50
Killing his light, SOMEONE creeps around toward the side of the house. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS203
01:12:31,00 --> 01:12:38,50
As SOMEONE moves through the shadows outside, SOMEONE takes off her blouse. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS204
01:12:46,00 --> 01:12:57,50
SOMEONE pounces on him. Outside, SOMEONE pauses and turns. Finding a bay window, he steps close and peeks in. He sees SOMEONE in her bra and skirt. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS206
01:13:46,00 --> 01:13:51,50
Her arms and legs wrapped around SOMEONE as she smothers him with kisses. His hands clenching her waist. He spins around the room erratically. SOMEONE looks away. His gaze heartbroken. He backs away from the window. He licks his lips, presses them tight, and leaves. Inside, lands - they knock heads - cut to black. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS207
01:14:55,00 --> 01:14:59,50
His legs clad in white pants. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS208
01:15:01,00 --> 01:15:13,50
In the pit, SOMEONE snores under SOMEONE. His eyes blink open and he gets his bearings. As SOMEONE arrives out back, SOMEONE's hand slaps down on the pit's rim. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS209
01:15:11,00 --> 01:15:16,50
Straining with effort, he pulls himself up. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS210
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:41,50
SOMEONE stares and points at her. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS211
01:16:41,00 --> 01:16:45,50
At the birthday party. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS213
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:06,50
SOMEONE nods. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS214
01:17:19,00 --> 01:17:23,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS216
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:18,50
SOMEONE leaves his car with the valet. A monk greets him. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS217
01:18:18,00 --> 01:18:24,50
Approach chauffeured carts. Passing a valet stand, SOMEONE pauses to dance. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS218
01:18:50,00 --> 01:18:55,50
He's off in a cart. SOMEONE stretches his quadriceps. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS219
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:07,50
Clinging by his legs, he opens his arms. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS220
01:19:10,00 --> 01:19:15,50
SOMEONE turns and sees SOMEONE approaching. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS221
01:19:55,00 --> 01:20:00,50
SOMEONE grins. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS223
01:20:08,00 --> 01:20:13,50
SOMEONE opens a shoebox. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS224
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:22,50
Kissing as the twins hug them. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS225
01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:26,50
He starts to cry. His tears landing on the stage below. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS226
01:20:29,00 --> 01:20:33,50
He gets dizzily to his feet. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS227
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:47,50
As he hobbles off, a boy offers him his cotton candy. SOMEONE takes it and goes to a tent. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS228
01:20:45,00 --> 01:20:51,50
Roz peeks inside and finds him sitting pensively. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS229
01:20:59,00 --> 01:21:04,50
Now, SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE, who sits. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS230
01:21:05,00 --> 01:21:09,50
SOMEONE lifts his chin. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS231
01:21:07,00 --> 01:21:12,50
SOMEONE eyes the drawing. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS232
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:16,50
SOMEONE scowls, holding a balloon. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS233
01:21:32,00 --> 01:21:39,50
With a smile, he holds out a plate of cake. SOMEONE punches him in the nose. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS234
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:42,50
He punches him again. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS235
01:21:40,00 --> 01:21:47,50
SOMEONE blocks a strike then hits SOMEONE in the face. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS236
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:53,50
SOMEONE slides off his jacket. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS237
01:21:55,00 --> 01:21:59,50
Pump his fists. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS238
01:22:02,00 --> 01:22:07,50
He punches him then beckons. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS239
01:22:05,00 --> 01:22:09,50
Removes his sweatshirt. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS240
01:22:09,00 --> 01:22:17,50
SOMEONE raises his fists and the two men face off. As SOMEONE throws a punch, SOMEONE blocks him. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS241
01:22:18,00 --> 01:22:27,50
To push him away. The older man flings him into a giant ball pit. SOMEONE disappears below the balls. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS243
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:35,50
He glances around but sees only the playing 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS244
01:22:35,00 --> 01:22:39,50
Behind him move then stop as he whip 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS245
01:22:38,00 --> 01:22:42,50
They shift in another part of the pit. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS246
01:22:49,00 --> 01:22:55,50
SOMEONE notices and stares with intense eyes. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS249
01:23:05,00 --> 01:23:11,50
Other balls shift and SOMEONE turns to them. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS250
01:23:08,00 --> 01:23:13,50
Behind him, SOMEONE burst through the surface. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS251
01:23:15,00 --> 01:23:19,50
Punches him. He grabs his son-in-law. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS253
01:23:42,00 --> 01:23:47,50
Pulled over, SOMEONE kicks his leg back and hits again to a bouncy castle.  

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS255
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:04,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE looks in the shoebox. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS256
01:24:06,00 --> 01:24:14,50
In the grass, SOMEONE faces Jinx, who stares at him. The cat licks its lips then advances. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS257
01:24:12,00 --> 01:24:19,50
He sniffs the lizard. Now, SOMEONE throws himself  

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS259
01:24:33,00 --> 01:24:37,50
Dangling for Jinx's mouth. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS260
01:24:39,00 --> 01:24:47,50
As SOMEONE races past him after the cat, SOMEONE stops. His chest heaving. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS261
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:51,50
He stretches his shoulders back. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS262
01:25:01,00 --> 01:25:06,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE kisses her. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS264
01:25:11,00 --> 01:25:16,50
SOMEONE lowers his arms. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS265
01:25:58,00 --> 01:26:09,50
Outside, SOMEONE races after Jinx. He stops. SOMEONE lies on the ground clutching his chest. She sprints over. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS267
01:26:32,00 --> 01:26:36,50
His cat approaching. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS268
01:26:36,00 --> 01:26:43,50
Pushing the cat's stomach like the Heimlich maneuver, he forces the lizard out. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS269
01:26:44,00 --> 01:26:50,50
SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE and SOMEONE returns his gaze to SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS270
01:26:49,00 --> 01:26:54,50
He rubs SOMEONE's shoulder. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS271
01:26:53,00 --> 01:26:58,50
Later, Medics wheel SOMEONE to an ambulance. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS272
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:02,50
He gives SOMEONE a look. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS273
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:24,50
SOMEONE winks. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS274
01:27:22,00 --> 01:27:26,50
In the ambulance. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS275
01:27:29,00 --> 01:27:33,50
Again looks at SOMEONE. SOMEONE replaces the mask. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS278
01:28:13,00 --> 01:28:18,50
He smiles as he holds SOMEONE's gaze. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS279
01:28:17,00 --> 01:28:23,50
He pats SOMEONE's cheek. His smile growing wider. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS280
01:28:22,00 --> 01:28:27,50
SOMEONE gives him a tender look. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS281
01:28:27,00 --> 01:28:31,50
SOMEONE winks at him. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS282
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:37,50
They lift the stretcher into their ridge. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS284
01:28:44,00 --> 01:28:52,50
Now, snowfalls onto a group of SOMEONEers. Words appear, "Four Months Later." 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS286
01:29:16,00 --> 01:29:20,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS287
01:29:19,00 --> 01:29:23,50
He lifts his leg. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS288
01:31:28,00 --> 01:31:34,50
Now in his basement lair, SOMEONE types on a computer. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS289
01:31:38,00 --> 01:31:59,50
As Jinx looks on, SOMEONE types his name into a Google search window. He trails his cursor over the search results then selects a YouTube video. It's title, Nurse Rags on Psycho Father-in-Law. The image loads up showing SOMEONE speaking at the medical convention. SOMEONE scowls. The video plays. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS18
00:02:52,00 --> 00:02:58,50
SOMEONE drives through dark streets and pulls into a car park. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS19
00:02:59,00 --> 00:03:03,50
Morning Glory. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS20
00:03:00,00 --> 00:03:06,50
SOMEONE hurries into a building. She walks down a corridor. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS21
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:11,50
She talks manically in a meeting. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS22
00:03:12,00 --> 00:03:17,50
The meeting room is behind a studio. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS23
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:20,50
A guy in the meeting has fallen asleep in front of his computer. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS24
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:33,50
SOMEONE chuckles with one of her colleagues. A female presenter, SOMEONE, yawns and sits at a desk in the studio. A male presenter, Ralph Pollard, sits next to her and a make-up artist brushes him with powder. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS25
00:03:31,00 --> 00:03:36,50
SOMEONE has headphones around her neck. She listens to one of them. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS26
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:42,50
Staff listen to headphones and watch screens. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS31
00:03:55,00 --> 00:03:59,50
In the studio, SOMEONE has fallen asleep. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS32
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:02,50
SOMEONE holds a headphone to her ear. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS33
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:13,50
SOMEONE wakes. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS34
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:19,50
A floor manager threw Post-It notes at her to wake her. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS35
00:04:46,00 --> 00:04:51,50
In the staff kitchen, SOMEONE gulps. In an office, 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS36
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:03,50
her friend that told her the news, SOMEONE leaves. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS37
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:05,50
The female presenter, SOMEONE, is onscreen. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS38
00:05:04,00 --> 00:05:09,50
A guy in the gallery directs. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS39
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:17,50
The studio, now empty, SOMEONE stands in it with a pile of papers in one hand and two mugs in the other. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS40
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:20,50
She smiles and turns to leave. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS41
00:05:29,00 --> 00:05:34,50
SOMEONE takes a t-shirt from a gift bag. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS42
00:05:36,00 --> 00:05:45,50
It's a red t-shirt with the words, Yes, I accept in white. SOMEONE puts it on under a denim jacket. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS43
00:05:42,00 --> 00:05:46,50
In her boss's office, 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS44
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:27,50
tears well in her eyes. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS45
00:06:55,00 --> 00:07:03,50
SOMEONE hugs SOMEONE. Her and other ex-colleagues are wearing Way to go, SOMEONE t-shirts. At her mum's. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS46
00:07:58,00 --> 00:08:04,50
SOMEONE lowers her gaze. She nods miserably. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS47
00:08:01,00 --> 00:08:05,50
SOMEONE's sitting in bed. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS48
00:08:03,00 --> 00:08:08,50
Her alarm goes off at 1:30. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS49
00:08:14,00 --> 00:08:20,50
She hugs her knees, then folds her arms across her. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS50
00:08:17,00 --> 00:08:22,50
She fidgets and stares into space. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS51
00:08:21,00 --> 00:08:25,50
She switches on the TV. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS52
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:30,50
She switches on another TV. On the phone. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS53
00:08:44,00 --> 00:08:48,50
In a diner. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS54
00:08:55,00 --> 00:08:59,50
In the park. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS55
00:09:39,00 --> 00:09:45,50
Now dressed in a suit, SOMEONE runs off a bus towards a ferry. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS56
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:48,50
On the other side of the river lies New York City. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS57
00:09:45,00 --> 00:09:52,50
She walks through the smart IBS high rise with a tall, lean guy, 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS58
00:09:49,00 --> 00:09:53,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS59
00:10:57,00 --> 00:11:01,50
She balls her fists. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS60
00:11:30,00 --> 00:11:36,50
He eyes her wryly. She balls her fists tighter. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS61
00:12:06,00 --> 00:12:10,50
SOMEONE looks down, 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS62
00:12:07,00 --> 00:12:12,50
then smiles sadly. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS63
00:12:10,00 --> 00:12:14,50
She gets up. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS64
00:12:20,00 --> 00:12:25,50
She opens the door and leaves. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS65
00:12:22,00 --> 00:12:29,50
Wearing a mournful expression, she trudges down a hallway and into a lift. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS67
00:12:29,00 --> 00:12:33,50
A fair-haired guy of about 30 walks in behind her, glances at her, 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS68
00:12:31,00 --> 00:12:35,50
then turns to the lift buttons and push it. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS69
00:12:40,00 --> 00:12:44,50
He presses the button. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS70
00:12:52,00 --> 00:12:58,50
As the lift doors are closing, a man jams his arms in the doors and pushes them open. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS71
00:12:56,00 --> 00:13:01,50
SOMEONE watches the guy get into the lift. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS72
00:12:58,00 --> 00:13:03,50
He's in his 60s and wears black-rimmed specs. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS73
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:05,50
SOMEONE gawps at him. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS74
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:10,50
She puts her hand on her heart. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS75
00:13:46,00 --> 00:13:50,50
The two guys get out. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS76
00:13:51,00 --> 00:13:57,50
SOMEONE jams her arm in the doors to stop them from closing. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS77
00:13:54,00 --> 00:14:00,50
She strolls along the street outside, her shoulders hunched. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS78
00:13:57,00 --> 00:14:03,50
She throws a bit of paper into a bin. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS79
00:14:03,00 --> 00:14:08,50
She takes a call on her mobile. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS80
00:14:16,00 --> 00:14:20,50
She hangs up the phone. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS81
00:14:20,00 --> 00:14:26,50
She jumps in the air. Pigeons fly off. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS82
00:14:45,00 --> 00:14:52,50
Sped-up footage. She packs up her apartment until it's completely empty. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS83
00:14:53,00 --> 00:14:59,50
She carries the last things into the removal truck and closes the door. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS84
00:14:57,00 --> 00:15:02,50
She jogs out of a subway in New York. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS85
00:15:01,00 --> 00:15:07,50
She runs across a busy road towards IBS. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS86
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:13,50
The skyscraper is white with large, dark windows. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS87
00:15:10,00 --> 00:15:18,50
Inside, SOMEONE waits on a bench in the wood-paneled reception area. There's a smart, gold desk. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS88
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:25,50
The attendant is watching a small TV. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS89
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:48,50
He smirks. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS90
00:17:15,00 --> 00:17:23,50
Then he takes SOMEONE's mug and goes. SOMEONE straightens up her fridge and knocks on a door. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS91
00:18:21,00 --> 00:18:25,50
The door handle comes off. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS92
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:44,50
They smile. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS93
00:18:58,00 --> 00:19:03,50
SOMEONE smiles uncertainly. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS94
00:19:05,00 --> 00:19:09,50
She raises her brows. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS95
00:20:45,00 --> 00:20:51,50
SOMEONE glances around at everyone talking at once. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS96
00:20:59,00 --> 00:21:07,50
SOMEONE licks her lips and turns to SOMEONE with interest. SOMEONE grins. SOMEONE frowns and pauses. She looks up. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS97
00:21:41,00 --> 00:21:44,50
SOMEONE heads off. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS98
00:21:45,00 --> 00:21:49,50
He steps back into the room. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS99
00:21:52,00 --> 00:22:00,50
She hits the table. SOMEONE loses his smirk and stares sourly at her. She holds his gaze. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS100
00:21:57,00 --> 00:22:03,50
A member of staff takes a photo on his phone. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS101

SOMEONE walks off. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS105
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:47,50
SOMEONE hurries along the street. She dials on her mobile, then holds it to her ear. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS106
00:22:50,00 --> 00:22:56,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch a horse-faced news anchor on TV. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS107
00:23:08,00 --> 00:23:12,50
She glances at him.

SOMEONE stares at her. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS113
00:26:20,00 --> 00:26:28,50
SOMEONE sits at a bench outside. She's eating a salad and going through the contract with a marker pen. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS114
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:30,50
Her brow is furrowed with intense concentration. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS115
00:26:28,00 --> 00:26:33,50
She lifts the contract and highlights a line. 

MORNING_GLORY_DVS116

00:26:38,00 --> 00:26:43,50
She stops just short of him,

01:43:12,00 --> 01:43:17,50
Fully clothed, he behind her with his arm around her 

NO_STRINGS_ATTACHED_DVS571
01:43:15,00 --> 01:43:19,50
they sleep peacefully. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS18
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:05,50
In a classroom the teenage boy draws in his textbook, sketching a mustached man with a worried face. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS19
00:03:03,00 --> 00:03:11,50
As a matronly teacher makes her way down an aisle other students hand her their assignments. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS20
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:18,50
The young artist sits concentrating, shading a shirt collar under the worried face. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS21
00:03:59,00 --> 00:04:19,50
SOMEONE collects his things and heads out. Now outside, he cuts across a grove of leafless trees beside a river. He stops and gazes ahead. He stands alone in his dark coat before a backdrop of buildings and a stonewall. Now he enters the school office where an assistant does paperwork. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS22
00:04:26,00 --> 00:04:32,50
A man behind a window beckons SOMEONE sternly. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS23
00:04:30,00 --> 00:04:37,50
In the Principal's office the young man slings his backpack to the floor. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS24
00:05:17,00 --> 00:05:22,50
SOMEONE drops his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS25
00:05:51,00 --> 00:05:57,50
SOMEONE gazes a scant at the departing student. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS26
00:05:55,00 --> 00:06:14,50
Collecting his book bag, SOMEONE heads off. Now he emerges from a stairwell unto the school roof. With parted lips he stares through the chain linked fence toward a highway and a distant bridge spanning the nearby river. Glancing over his shoulder, he spots an onlooker across the rooftop. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS27
00:06:12,00 --> 00:06:21,50
One of the three students from the lunchroom, a blond girl, exhales smoke and meets his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS28
00:06:20,00 --> 00:06:27,50
As SOMEONE faintly smiles, the stairwell door opens. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS29
00:06:24,00 --> 00:06:30,50
The blond tosses her cigarette through the fence. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS30
00:06:28,00 --> 00:06:33,50
SOMEONE quickly takes out a cigarette. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS31
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:37,50
A dark haired faculty member arrives. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS32
00:06:42,00 --> 00:06:48,50
The blond mouths thank you as she leaves. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS33
00:06:47,00 --> 00:07:07,50
Later. Entering a stylish apartment, SOMEONE walks a hall to a spacious living room with a comfy sitting area and a baby grand piano. In the kitchen he pours a bowl of cereal. A middle-aged woman enters and sets a briefcase on the table. SOMEONE averts his gaze from hers as he gets milk from the fridge. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS34
00:07:54,00 --> 00:08:05,50
He takes his leave. Now seated at a white canvas in school he draws in pencil. Charcoal portraits decorate the walls. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS35
00:08:04,00 --> 00:08:11,50
A gray haired bearded instructor approaches glowering. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS36
00:08:15,00 --> 00:08:23,50
His drawing shows a fist punching the teeth out of the bearded teacher's grotesque caricature. SOMEONE punches him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS38
00:08:50,00 --> 00:09:02,50
Other art students glance up from their work. Now, SOMEONE exits the building. As the blond girl tries to walk abreast of him, SOMEONE ignores her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS39
00:09:02,00 --> 00:09:07,50
She catches up on the sidewalk. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS40
00:09:28,00 --> 00:09:34,50
On a nearby court boys shoot baskets. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS41
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:19,50
SOMEONE bites her lip thoughtfully. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS42
00:10:27,00 --> 00:10:31,50
SOMEONE glares as she spots 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS43
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:34,50
a couple canoodling on a brown stone stairway. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS44
00:10:34,00 --> 00:10:46,50
SOMEONE in a negligee and robe, the woman kisses a younger man, then flirtatiously touches his coat lapel. Her gaze follows as he makes his way past SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS45
00:10:46,00 --> 00:10:53,50
SOMEONE's mother heads indoors. SOMEONE stares, transfixed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS46
00:10:52,00 --> 00:11:00,50
The kids enter a well-appointed dining area where SOMEONE's mom holds a drink. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS47
00:11:16,00 --> 00:11:21,50
Now, the three share drinks on a patio. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS48
00:11:35,00 --> 00:11:42,50
Mrs. SOMEONE touches SOMEONE's leg. He jolts spilling his beer. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS49
00:11:39,00 --> 00:11:44,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS50
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:55,50
Mrs. SOMEONE steps away. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS51
00:12:34,00 --> 00:12:40,50
SOMEONE grins, his eyes darting. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS52
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:54,50
SOMEONE rises, smiling. SOMEONE's gaze meet his expectantly 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS53
00:12:51,00 --> 00:12:58,50
and she offers a demure smile. SOMEONE returns a winsome shrug. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS54
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:04,50
He lingers a moment then heads inside. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS55
00:13:03,00 --> 00:13:09,50
SOMEONE leans forward, resting her head on her hand. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS56
00:13:09,00 --> 00:13:17,50
Now, leafless trees silhouette the dusky horizon where SOMEONE stops and gazes off. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS57
00:13:18,00 --> 00:13:26,50
He opens the door to his dimly lit apartment. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS58
00:13:23,00 --> 00:13:33,50
He flicks a light switch, then another with no effect. Candles illuminate the living room and dining area.  

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS59
00:13:53,00 --> 00:13:58,50
At the table, SOMEONE's mother shares a meal with a middle aged man. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS61
00:14:15,00 --> 00:14:22,50
Later on a balcony, he gazes toward the twinkling Manhattan skyline. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS62
00:14:20,00 --> 00:14:27,50
At school a pretty teacher in bookish glasses leads a class. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS63
00:14:24,00 --> 00:14:30,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE in the desk to his right. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS64
00:14:33,00 --> 00:14:39,50
SOMEONE adds detail to a doodle die ball. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS65
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:47,50
He looks up. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS66
00:14:57,00 --> 00:15:03,50
SOMEONE absent-mindedly thumbs the pages of a book. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS67
00:15:02,00 --> 00:15:07,50
SOMEONE grins. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS68
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:42,50
Under the teacher's beaming gaze he fidgets. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS69
00:15:42,00 --> 00:15:56,50
He shoots a glance at SOMEONE. Now he crosses the lunchroom where SOMEONE sits with her two friends, a dark haired girl and a preppy guy. SOMEONE catches his eye as SOMEONE starts to take a seat at an empty table. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS70
00:15:55,00 --> 00:16:00,50
He approaches, tray in hand. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS71
00:16:27,00 --> 00:16:31,50
SOMEONE hands him a textbook. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS72
00:16:28,00 --> 00:16:39,50
SOMEONE scans the pages revealing severe black and white renderings of faces, eyes and mouths. Some punctuated with red. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS73
00:16:54,00 --> 00:16:59,50
SOMEONE nods tentatively. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS74
00:16:59,00 --> 00:17:12,50
Now in his bedroom, SOMEONE sits at a desk. He leans over a sketchbook with a pen and adds to a drawing which includes a horned Cyclops wearing a party hat. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS75
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:17,50
SOMEONE covers his sketch with homework as SOMEONE enters. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS76
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:39,50
As SOMEONE pretends to resume his homework, a pleased SOMEONE steps out. The teen sticks the assignment into a textbook, then returns to his drawing. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS77
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:46,50
He adds shoulders to a grimacing demon within a starburst design. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS78
00:17:44,00 --> 00:17:49,50
The next day he arrives at school and opens the doors which have been decorated with paper snowflakes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS79
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:05,50
At lunch. His drawing shows the demon punching through the page. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS80
00:18:10,00 --> 00:18:20,50
He cracks a smile. Now Asian lettering adorns shops in Chinatown. SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk up from a Subway station. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS81
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:53,50
Later they eat from takeout containers. Now a film shows a man and boy descending a spiral staircase on the Eiffel Tower. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS82
00:18:51,00 --> 00:19:01,50
Subtitles. Tell me why aren't you married? I haven't found my dream girl. In the movie theater, SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE who wears glasses. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS83
00:18:59,00 --> 00:19:07,50
Do you like me? Of course not. A Marquee reads Zazie Dans le Metro. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS84
00:19:28,00 --> 00:19:33,50
Across the street SOMEONE walks alone. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS86
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:37,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE round a corner and spy on him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS87
00:19:48,00 --> 00:20:02,50
Wearing his trench coat SOMEONE slowly ambles along with a briefcase in hand. SOMEONE and SOMEONE peer around the nose of a truck and watch him enter a coffee shop called, The Cup & Saucer. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS88
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:06,50
SOMEONE takes a seat at a window. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS89
00:20:08,00 --> 00:20:13,50
SOMEONE watches his stepfather do paperwork. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS90
00:20:11,00 --> 00:20:19,50
Now at school, as the teen heads up a stairwell the Principal blocks his path. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS91
00:20:48,00 --> 00:20:53,50
He sips from a mug. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS92
00:21:21,00 --> 00:21:34,50
The principal heads off. Now a banner hangs over the school entrance, Career Fair. SOMEONE steps outside with his shirt tucked in and a nametag on his chest. He looks around. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS93
00:21:33,00 --> 00:21:46,50
He spots a scruffy looking guy standing across the street then heads in his direction. With his back turned to the approaching student the unshaven man hunches over to light a cigarette. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS95
00:22:28,00 --> 00:22:33,50
A monitor shows an abstract painting. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS96
00:22:57,00 --> 00:23:02,50
Later, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit on a boulder. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS97
00:23:12,00 --> 00:23:19,50
SOMEONE musses up his own hair. SOMEONE sits back and folds his arms. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS98
00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:40,50
Holding a coffee with both hands, SOMEONE stares at him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS99
00:23:56,00 --> 00:24:04,50
SOMEONE glances at his coffee. Now, he and SOMEONE stroll along a sidewalk. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS100
00:24:18,00 --> 00:24:25,50
SOMEONE smirks, then shakes her head and continues on alone. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS101
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:32,50
Watching her go, SOMEONE smiles to himself. About 50 yards away SOMEONE glances back. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS102
00:24:29,00 --> 00:24:46,50
Now traffic passes several evergreens adorned with lights. The image dissolves to the trees at night as more traffic crawls by. On another day, a taxi drives over the Manhattan Bridge. Riding in the back seat, SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE who sits beside him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS103
00:24:43,00 --> 00:24:48,50
She glances out his window. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS104
00:24:48,00 --> 00:24:56,50
SOMEONE sits up following her gaze past a railing to a cluster of industrial brick buildings. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS105
00:24:54,00 --> 00:25:03,50
An American flag waves atop a pillar on the distant Brooklyn Bridge. SOMEONE smiles to himself. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS106
00:25:00,00 --> 00:25:05,50
Now he presses a doorbell. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS107
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:11,50
The teens wait outside a blue building. SOMEONE shoves the door open. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS108
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:14,50
Seeing SOMEONE with SOMEONE, he giggles. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS109
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:22,50
He gestures inside. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS110
00:25:19,00 --> 00:25:26,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter. SOMEONE yanks the door shut behind them. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS111
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:30,50
Inside his studio they look over various paintings. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS112
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:40,50
He points to one. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS113
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:44,50
SOMEONE wanders off alone. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS114
00:26:02,00 --> 00:26:08,50
Later, SOMEONE looks over SOMEONE's sketchbook. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS115
00:26:38,00 --> 00:26:44,50
He glances at SOMEONE who sits in the next room. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS116
00:26:48,00 --> 00:26:53,50
SOMEONE looks at her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS117
00:26:51,00 --> 00:26:56,50
He peers out the window. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS118
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:24,50
He returns his attention to the sketchbook. SOMEONE shifts his gaze. That night he and SOMEONE ride back in a cab. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS119
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:56,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes curiously then folds her legs. She and SOMEONE each look out their windows. Traffic drives past the median lined with Christmas trees. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS120
00:27:53,00 --> 00:27:57,50
Now at dinner. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS121
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:04,50
SOMEONE text messages. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS122
00:28:05,00 --> 00:28:18,50
Later in his room, he lies on his bed with an art book. He flips back several pages and studies a red hued painting of a figure standing under bare trees before a distant building. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS123
00:28:20,00 --> 00:28:28,50
Turning to the next page he studies an oil painting of a woman in a ruffled dress facing a mirror. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS124
00:28:29,00 --> 00:28:40,50
He turns the page again and studies a portrait of a sickly somber faced boy. The transfixed teen focuses on the boy's dark eyes, 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS125
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:44,50
which seem to stair back at him. Shades of peach represent the subject's 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS126
00:28:41,00 --> 00:28:48,50
fair skin. Now in a gallery, patrons gather around SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS127
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:03,50
He notices SOMEONE approaching. A photographer snaps a picture. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS128
00:29:00,00 --> 00:29:05,50
SOMEONE stares past SOMEONE and frowns. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS129
00:29:05,00 --> 00:29:12,50
He turns around and sees only blank canvases adorning the walls. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS130
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:18,50
Now he awakes in bed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS131
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:38,50
On a busy city street, traffic lights turn from green to red. In the kitchen SOMEONE fills a bowl with cereal, then glances around. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS132
00:29:37,00 --> 00:29:43,50
He pours in the last few drops of milk from a carton. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS133
00:29:44,00 --> 00:29:52,50
Stepping into a doorway, he sees SOMEONE hunched over paperwork in an office across the hall. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS134
00:29:55,00 --> 00:30:03,50
SOMEONE watches his frustrated stepfather set one page aside and grab another. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS135
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:16,50
The teen takes out his cellphone and reads a text message from SOMEONE, Happy New Year. Meet me at SOMEONE's. 6 SOMEONE Circle. 20th floor. SOMEONE walks off. Now he knocks on a door. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS136
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:20,50
SOMEONE answers it wearing a shiny Lamé dress. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS137
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:23,50
SOMEONE gawks at her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS138
00:30:26,00 --> 00:30:31,50
He follows her inside. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS139
00:30:34,00 --> 00:30:41,50
She leads him downstairs to a chic living room where they join SOMEONE and a girlfriend. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS140
00:30:57,00 --> 00:31:03,50
A blond guy sits across from them. His friend sits beside SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS141
00:31:23,00 --> 00:31:27,50
SOMEONE arrives. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS142
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:37,50
SOMEONE picks up a card reading, New Year's Eve Party. Then flips it over to find his drawing. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS143
00:31:35,00 --> 00:31:40,50
He smiles at his work. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS144
00:31:43,00 --> 00:31:50,50
Later on a quiet street SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk together following the others. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS145
00:31:48,00 --> 00:31:54,50
Now in a trendy nightclub, she leads him through the crowd. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS146
00:32:03,00 --> 00:32:08,50
She leads him across the dance floor. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS147
00:32:11,00 --> 00:32:24,50
SOMEONE hands him a bottle of champagne. SOMEONE leads SOMEONE to the middle of the dance floor. A strobe light flashes on the anxious teen. Facing him, SOMEONE brushes back her hair. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS148
00:32:22,00 --> 00:32:29,50
SOMEONE tries to dance, awkwardly swaying to the music. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS149
00:32:26,00 --> 00:32:31,50
SOMEONE grins as she watches him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS150
00:32:31,00 --> 00:32:38,50
SOMEONE smiles and watches her dance ecstatically with her eyes closed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS151
00:32:39,00 --> 00:32:46,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hug. As he dances close to her she looks at SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS152
00:32:45,00 --> 00:32:53,50
He pleasantly raises his bottle of champagne then backs away disappearing within the crowd. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS153
00:32:53,00 --> 00:33:01,50
SOMEONE watches him go, then turns her attention back to SOMEONE as she dances with him joyfully. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS154
00:33:01,00 --> 00:33:07,50
Now, SOMEONE walks through the crowd. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS155
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:13,50
He approaches SOMEONE's friends at the bar. SOMEONE turns to him, holding a shot. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS156
00:33:10,00 --> 00:33:15,50
They all raise shots. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS157
00:33:15,00 --> 00:33:20,50
SOMEONE studies SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS158
00:33:35,00 --> 00:33:41,50
A blond girl whispers in SOMEONE's ear then leads her off. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS159
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:46,50
SOMEONE watches her go. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS161
00:33:45,00 --> 00:33:56,50
Wandering through the crowded dance floor SOMEONE glimpses SOMEONE still dancing with SOMEONE. As SOMEONE moves on someone hands him a shot. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS162
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:01,50
He toasts with the group. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS163
00:34:00,00 --> 00:34:12,50
A brilliant disco lights swings by overhead as he shifts his dull gaze. Strobe-like flashes of the tightly packed club goers go in and out of focus. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS164
00:34:11,00 --> 00:34:17,50
SOMEONE stumbles through the crowd. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS165
00:34:14,00 --> 00:34:23,50
Outside, he shuffles across the street and vomits, catching the attention of two bystanders. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS166
00:34:24,00 --> 00:34:29,50
He sits back against a wall. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS167
00:34:27,00 --> 00:34:31,50
He spits. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS168
00:34:30,00 --> 00:34:37,50
A string of saliva falls from his mouth as he sits up and catches his breath. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS169
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:45,50
He undoes a button of his shirt, then hangs his head with his eyes half closed. Down the block, a group of pedestrians walks by. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS170
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:53,50
Later, SOMEONE lies alone, passed out against the wall. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS171
00:34:50,00 --> 00:34:58,50
Crossing the street, SOMEONE picks up her pace as she finds her lost friend. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS172
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:06,50
She crouches at SOMEONE's side and helps him sit up against the graffitied wall. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS173
00:35:05,00 --> 00:35:16,50
Now, with SOMEONE's arm draped over her shoulders, SOMEONE helps him into her bedroom. Leaning him against the door jam, she doffs her coat. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS174
00:35:23,00 --> 00:35:29,50
She rolls out the lower level of a trundle bed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS175
00:35:29,00 --> 00:35:34,50
She grabs a pillow and a comforter. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS176
00:35:43,00 --> 00:35:49,50
She twitches a smile then straightens SOMEONE's overcoat. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS177
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:56,50
SOMEONE blinks over her smile and averts her gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS178
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:05,50
With a kind look she reaches for him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS179
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:19,50
She slides his coat off then steadies him as he staggers to the bed. Holding his side, she guides him to the lower bed beside her own. He flops back on it, then watches as she spreads the comforter over him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS180
00:36:16,00 --> 00:36:23,50
SOMEONE turns her back to him and switches off a lamp on a dresser. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS181
00:36:20,00 --> 00:36:28,50
As SOMEONE's eyelids open and close between wakefulness and sleep, he glimpses her intermittently. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS182
00:36:26,00 --> 00:36:32,50
With her back to him, SOMEONE slides out a dresser drawer. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS183
00:36:30,00 --> 00:36:37,50
She pulls her dress up over her head, revealing her bra. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS184
00:36:35,00 --> 00:36:40,50
She puts on a three quarter sleeve baseball T. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS185
00:36:38,00 --> 00:36:45,50
As she dons pajama pants, she glances over her shoulder at SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS186
00:36:42,00 --> 00:36:48,50
He sees her just before his eyes fall shut. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS187
00:36:45,00 --> 00:36:52,50
One last glimpse shows the dresser without SOMEONE in front of it. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS188
00:36:50,00 --> 00:36:57,50
Now, pale light glows on SOMEONE's sleeping face. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS189
00:36:54,00 --> 00:36:59,50
His eyelids flutter and he wakes up. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS190
00:36:56,00 --> 00:37:04,50
Shifting his head on the pillow, he turns to SOMEONE and watches her sleep. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS191
00:37:07,00 --> 00:37:17,50
He props himself up on his elbows and sweeps his gaze up SOMEONE's face, taking in her rosy lips, smooth cheeks, and closed eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS193
00:37:16,00 --> 00:37:22,50
Still studying her beauty, he lies back. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS194
00:37:22,00 --> 00:37:30,50
With his thoughtful gaze fixed on the sleeping girl, SOMEONE lets his eyelids shut. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS195
00:37:30,00 --> 00:37:46,50
Morning. Propped on one elbow, SOMEONE sits awake in bed, her eyes darting to the lower regions of SOMEONE's blanket. She presses her lips together to stifle a smile, then shifts her gaze to SOMEONE who blinks awake and looks up at her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS196
00:37:48,00 --> 00:37:58,50
He smiles. Following SOMEONE's gaze, he sees his morning wood jetting up under the blanket. He rolls off the bed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS197
00:37:55,00 --> 00:38:01,50
He glances at SOMEONE, then drops his head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS198
00:37:58,00 --> 00:38:08,50
Later in the dining room, Mrs. SOMEONE brings SOMEONE a Bloody SOMEONE garnished with a celery stalk and bendy straw. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS199
00:38:15,00 --> 00:38:23,50
Sitting kitty corner to SOMEONE's mom SOMEONE nods, then sips the drink. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS200
00:38:22,00 --> 00:38:27,50
He shoots her an alarmed look. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS201
00:38:36,00 --> 00:38:44,50
She pushes her chair out and strides away. Her mother glances after her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS202
00:38:43,00 --> 00:38:47,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS203
00:38:45,00 --> 00:39:04,50
He lifts the straw to his lips and drinks. Now he follows SOMEONE down a sidewalk. Slowing his pace, he watches his stepfather grab a newspaper off the top of a trash can then cross the street. With his eyes fixed on the man, SOMEONE remains on the opposite sidewalk. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS204
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:08,50
He pauses behind a pair of pay phones then takes a few steps and sees 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS205
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:11,50
SOMEONE sitting on a bench in a crowded bus shelter. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS206
00:39:08,00 --> 00:39:14,50
The people waiting around him stir as a bus pulls up. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS207
00:39:11,00 --> 00:39:18,50
The bus glides away to reveal SOMEONE alone on the shelter bench. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS208
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:37,50
He reads the newspaper. Later SOMEONE exits an elevator in an office building. He walks down a barren corridor and stops in front of a door. His jaw drops as he spots an eviction notice taped to it. The door's shiny nameplate reads, SOMEONE Sargent. Marketing Research Incorporated. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS209
00:39:35,00 --> 00:39:45,50
Nighttime. Wearing dark framed glasses, SOMEONE sits on her bed and reads. Her mother joins her as she folds her daughter's clothes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS210
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:40,50
SOMEONE gives her mother a pointed look. With a faint smile, Charlotte glances away. Now in a gallery at the Whitney Museum, SOMEONE and SOMEONE face a gray canvas covered with chalky scribbles. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS211
00:40:58,00 --> 00:41:07,50
Wearing a coiled white scarf, SOMEONE moves to a painting of two red rectangles below a white one. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS212
00:41:09,00 --> 00:41:14,50
SOMEONE nods uncertainly. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS213
00:41:23,00 --> 00:41:29,50
He glances at SOMEONE then returns his gaze to the paintings. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS214
00:41:26,00 --> 00:41:34,50
SOMEONE shrugs, then moves to another painting. SOMEONE joins him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS215
00:41:53,00 --> 00:41:59,50
SOMEONE gazes at the piece of art. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS216
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:07,50
SOMEONE eyes him thoughtfully, then steps in front of the next piece. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS217
00:42:04,00 --> 00:42:14,50
The sharp perspective canvas shows six rows of plates each holding a slice of cake or pie identical to the others in its row. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS219
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:21,50
He gives an embarrassed shrug. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS220
00:42:20,00 --> 00:42:25,50
SOMEONE eyes the plates. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS221
00:42:27,00 --> 00:42:34,50
With a knowing smile, SOMEONE leaves SOMEONE staring at the image. SOMEONE leaves. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS222
00:42:33,00 --> 00:42:39,50
Now SOMEONE sits across from SOMEONE at a restaurant. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS223
00:42:36,00 --> 00:42:43,50
A plastic table stand between them reads, Valentine's Day menu. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS224
00:42:55,00 --> 00:43:00,50
SOMEONE nods and smiles. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS225
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:26,50
Nodding, SOMEONE stares down at the table. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS226
00:43:41,00 --> 00:43:46,50
He folds his hands on the table. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS228
00:44:34,00 --> 00:44:38,50
Staring at SOMEONE, he gives a faint sad smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS229
00:44:38,00 --> 00:44:45,50
SOMEONE shoots him a thoughtful look, then lowers her eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS230
00:44:46,00 --> 00:44:50,50
She meets his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS231
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:57,50
Starring into SOMEONE's eyes, SOMEONE gives a tiny nod. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS232
00:44:54,00 --> 00:45:00,50
She twitches a smile then brushes hair away from her face. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS233
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:20,50
He grins. SOMEONE rumples her lips. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS234
00:45:30,00 --> 00:45:35,50
SOMEONE stares at her with hard eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS235
00:45:37,00 --> 00:45:44,50
SOMEONE presses his lips into a tight line. He averts his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS236
00:46:02,00 --> 00:46:10,50
As she peers directly at SOMEONE his eyes widen. His lips part fumbling. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS237
00:46:08,00 --> 00:46:12,50
SOMEONE bows her head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS238
00:46:20,00 --> 00:46:27,50
She averts her gaze as SOMEONE stares crestfallen, SOMEONE leans toward him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS239
00:46:29,00 --> 00:46:35,50
As she sits back and sips her drink SOMEONE lowers his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS240
00:46:34,00 --> 00:46:44,50
Later, heading down a sidewalk with SOMEONE, SOMEONE stares straight ahead. His hands in his pockets and his face sullen. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS241
00:46:43,00 --> 00:46:48,50
SOMEONE glances at him but he avoids her gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS242
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:54,50
He looks down thoughtfully. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS243
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:57,50
He stops walking. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS244
00:47:04,00 --> 00:47:11,50
SOMEONE blinks her confused eyes. SOMEONE stares back angrily. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS245
00:47:11,00 --> 00:47:16,50
He turns on his heels and strides away. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS246
00:47:15,00 --> 00:47:23,50
Staring after him she shakes her head then storms off in the opposite direction. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS247
00:47:20,00 --> 00:47:29,50
Now, SOMEONE lies on his bed with his hands folded under his head. His iPod plays beside him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS248
00:47:28,00 --> 00:47:39,50
His phone display flashes. SOMEONE calling. With a sour look, he rejects the calls then smooths the front of his shirt and folds his hands behind his head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS249
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:53,50
SOMEONE shoots his cell a brooding glance, then reaches for his iPod and hits play. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS250
00:47:53,00 --> 00:48:01,50
Now he wears a different but similar outfit as he lies on his bed with his eyes closed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS251
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:08,50
His mother raps on the door. She opens it and looks in. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS252
00:48:27,00 --> 00:48:33,50
His mother stares at him, her brow creased. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS253
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:41,50
Slack jawed, she closes the door as she leaves. SOMEONE lies with his arms folded over his stomach and his eyes shut. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS254
00:48:43,00 --> 00:48:49,50
He presses play on his iPod and lies back. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS255
00:48:49,00 --> 00:49:04,50
Now at school SOMEONE sits in the lunchroom with SOMEONE and SOMEONE. She glances back at SOMEONE reading alone one table away. SOMEONE scrutinizes him curiously, and SOMEONE wears a wounded expression. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS256
00:49:01,00 --> 00:49:10,50
Later, SOMEONE lies on his bed gazing dourly at the ceiling. SOMEONE opens the door and gawks. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS257
00:49:22,00 --> 00:49:26,50
SOMEONE stares at him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS258
00:49:26,00 --> 00:49:37,50
Rolling his eyes, SOMEONE returns his gaze to the ceiling. SOMEONE stares at him for a moment then backs out of the room and closes the door. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS259
00:49:38,00 --> 00:49:45,50
SOMEONE shuts his eyes. Meanwhile SOMEONE listens on her phone. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS260
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:49,50
She ends the call then hits redial. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS261
00:49:51,00 --> 00:50:20,50
With a frustrated look she hangs up. Striding down a waterfront walkway she pauses as she notices someone up ahead. She smiles faintly then heads over to SOMEONE who sits on a low stonewall sketching on a pad. Later, SOMEONE strides down a sidewalk. SOMEONE approaches from the opposite direction. His hands in his coat pockets and his gaze fixed on the ground. The two teens walk right past each other offering no sign of acknowledgment. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS262
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:27,50
Evening. Pale sunlight gleams off cars parked on both sides of a city. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS263
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:40,50
White letters on a red sign outside of a bar read, SOMEONE's. Sitting alone inside SOMEONE brushes her bangs out of her face, then glances at the door as it opens. SOMEONE joins her at the bar. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS264
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:16,50
Shifting uneasily, SOMEONE tucks some hair behind one ear. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS265
00:51:22,00 --> 00:51:34,50
One elbow on the bar, SOMEONE runs a hand through his wavy hair. He props his head on it and gazes at SOMEONE with wistful eyes. He offers a restrained smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS266
00:51:39,00 --> 00:51:44,50
She gives him an annoyed look. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS267
00:51:43,00 --> 00:51:50,50
As she gently sways back and forth in her seat, SOMEONE turns away. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS268
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:54,50
SOMEONE slides out of her chair. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS269
00:51:51,00 --> 00:51:56,50
She offers her hand. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS270
00:51:54,00 --> 00:52:08,50
SOMEONE accepts, then rises from his chair. Gazing into his eyes, she lifts his hand and spins under his arm. As she pulls him in and starts to dance he sits again. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS271
00:52:11,00 --> 00:52:20,50
SOMEONE nods then breaks into a flirtatious smile. Closing her eyes, she begins to dance in front of SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS272
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:31,50
She sways sensually and the artist gives a longing look. Daytime. In class, SOMEONE stares out a window at a neighboring building. A bird flies past. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS273
00:52:28,00 --> 00:52:36,50
As his English teacher collects the students’ papers, she stops at his desk and touches his shoulder. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS274
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:39,50
She notes his distant expression. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS275
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:59,50
His teacher frowns. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS276
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:02,50
SOMEONE averts his head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS277
00:53:03,00 --> 00:53:08,50
Now, SOMEONE arrives at the school office. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS278
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:16,50
The assistant sheepishly meets his gaze. SOMEONE proceeds to the Principal's office. Later he sits wringing his hands. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS279
00:53:34,00 --> 00:53:40,50
Three of SOMEONE's teachers sit in the room. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS280
00:54:21,00 --> 00:54:26,50
The English teacher purses her lip. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS281
00:54:23,00 --> 00:54:30,50
With glistening eyes, SOMEONE looks up at SOMEONE who avoids his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS282
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:47,50
The math teacher gives him a harsh look. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS283
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:50,50
He rubs tears from his eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS284
00:55:07,00 --> 00:55:16,50
The sober faced teachers stay put as SOMEONE gets up from the couch and exits. He turns back at the open door. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS285
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:26,50
He continues out with a numb expression. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS286
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:29,50
Now Vivian and SOMEONE sit waiting for him at home. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS287
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:34,50
The distraught mother dabs at the corners of her eyes with her pinkie. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS288
00:55:33,00 --> 00:55:38,50
SOMEONE steps into the room. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS289
00:56:38,00 --> 00:56:44,50
SOMEONE grabs him roughly and they wrestle to the floor. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS290
00:56:42,00 --> 00:56:49,50
As SOMEONE gets back up his stepfather restrains him from behind. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS291
00:56:47,00 --> 00:56:55,50
He backs SOMEONE into the doorframe and the older man slumps to the floor clutching his shoulder. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS292
00:56:53,00 --> 00:56:58,50
The troubled teen runs out. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS293
00:56:55,00 --> 00:57:02,50
Later, our view chases after him as he races through the park. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS294
00:57:01,00 --> 00:57:08,50
Night falls as he bolts down SOMEONE's street and into her apartment building. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS295
00:57:13,00 --> 00:57:18,50
He catches his breath as she answers. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS296
00:57:17,00 --> 00:57:22,50
She slips out shutting the door behind her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS297
00:57:25,00 --> 00:57:30,50
He presses her up against the door and kisses her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS298
00:57:32,00 --> 00:57:38,50
She pushes him back and frowns uncomfortably. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS299
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:43,50
With a heavy blink, she lifts her brown eyes to meet his. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS300
00:57:42,00 --> 00:57:51,50
SOMEONE twists the doorknob behind her back. She pushes the door open a crack and SOMEONE takes a look inside. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS301
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:56,50
Charlotte sits on the sofa near SOMEONE who guiltily leans forward in an armchair. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS302
00:57:53,00 --> 00:57:59,50
Later, SOMEONE marches away from the apartment building. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS303
00:57:58,00 --> 00:58:03,50
SOMEONE runs out after him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS304
00:58:04,00 --> 00:58:10,50
The boy turns around with a wounded glare. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS305
00:58:09,00 --> 00:58:14,50
SOMEONE pouts, his eyes glistening. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS306
00:58:53,00 --> 00:58:58,50
Tears stream down SOMEONE's cheek. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS307
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:02,50
The boy dries his face 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS308
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:04,50
with his sleeve, then glances off pensively. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS309
00:59:03,00 --> 00:59:08,50
He flashes a wry dimpled smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS310
00:59:07,00 --> 00:59:13,50
Dusting contritely shifts his arms at his sides. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS311
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:18,50
SOMEONE's chin furrows sadly as he stares at his mentor. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS312
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:20,50
SOMEONE returns a solemn, remorseful look. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS313
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:31,50
SOMEONE turns around and mopes off down the block of brown stone buildings. Later he sulks at a bar while SOMEONE, SOMEONE and others have a good time all around him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS314
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:35,50
Someone passes in front of our view as the picture fades to black. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS315
00:59:36,00 --> 00:59:44,50
In the early morning under a gray sky SOMEONE walks down the middle of a street. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS316
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:53,50
Later he strolls through a park on a pathway between tall leafy trees and approaches Vivian sitting on a bench. His shoulders sag as he lets out a sigh. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS317
00:59:51,00 --> 00:59:57,50
His mother smiles at him and lifts her eyebrows. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS318
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:36,50
SOMEONE tightens his lips and takes a seat beside her on the bench. He folds his overcoat closed as a strong breeze blows through some trees and bushes at a wall behind them. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS319
01:01:22,00 --> 01:01:28,50
Smiling gently she closes her eyes and lets out a breath. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS320
01:01:39,00 --> 01:01:48,50
She closes her hands over her nose and mouth as she sobs. SOMEONE puts his arm around her and kisses her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS321
01:01:48,00 --> 01:01:54,50
He rests his cheek against her honey blond hair. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS322
01:01:53,00 --> 01:01:59,50
Later, SOMEONE strides into the Principal's office. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS323
01:02:17,00 --> 01:02:22,50
SOMEONE hurries out. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS324
01:02:19,00 --> 01:02:24,50
Now in the art room. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS325
01:03:23,00 --> 01:03:30,50
Later, SOMEONE leaves the school with a tall stack of assignments. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS326
01:03:28,00 --> 01:03:33,50
SOMEONE falls into step with him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS327
01:03:48,00 --> 01:03:53,50
SOMEONE stops and faces her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS328
01:03:55,00 --> 01:04:02,50
SOMEONE's mouth creases as she stares at him remorsefully. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS329
01:04:06,00 --> 01:04:11,50
He walks off leaving her behind. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS330
01:04:10,00 --> 01:04:14,50
Later at home. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS332
01:04:23,00 --> 01:04:45,50
As he heads off, Vivian watches him fondly. In his bedroom SOMEONE plops the thick stack of assignments down on his desk. He removes his coat. Rolling up his sleeves he takes a seat at his desk and straightens the pile of homework. He stares at the daunting stack of folders and assignment books for a moment then turns on a lamp and opens up his laptop. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS333
01:04:42,00 --> 01:04:50,50
On another day, our view travels across his bedroom to find him hard at work at his desk. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS334
01:05:01,00 --> 01:05:08,50
He works out a trigonometry equation. Vivian shows in another couple. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS335
01:05:17,00 --> 01:05:29,50
Later, SOMEONE sets up a blank canvas on an easel and stares at it. In the kitchen Vivian wraps up pieces of pottery in newspaper and boxes them. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS336
01:05:36,00 --> 01:05:42,50
SOMEONE writes an essay on ruled notebook paper. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS337
01:05:43,00 --> 01:05:50,50
He now takes a brush to his canvas and starts his painting. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS338
01:05:48,00 --> 01:06:19,50
He mixes shades of emerald and white to form a pale green. Later on the canvas, he uses thick brush strokes to apply streaks of white over the green. He paints a purple vertical line, then shadows it in burnt sienna. Now at school he writes an essay for his English final. Later he uses a calculator to work out a problem for his trig final. Back at home, he solves another long equation, types on his laptop and fills in answers on some French homework. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS339
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:53,50
He types up a paper citing the Thoreau's Civil Disobedience. Taking an essay test he begins an answer with a mention of SOMEONE Bacon and SOMEONE Hockney. For a multiple-choice question he circles the answer, Renaissance. Back at home he rubs his eye then places a completed assignment atop a stack and grabs the next piece of homework. Now in his loft, SOMEONE works on a painting as dawn breaks outside his windows. SOMEONE wakes up in his bed and watches him deliberately stub out a lit cigarette near the bottom corner of the canvas. Her eyes lower pensively. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS340
01:06:55,00 --> 01:07:02,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE works on his own painting in a white T-shirt. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS341
01:07:03,00 --> 01:07:11,50
Vivian smiles in his doorway drying her hands on a towel. SOMEONE grins. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS342
01:07:09,00 --> 01:07:14,50
Vivian looks around the bare walls. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS343
01:07:14,00 --> 01:07:20,50
He eyes his canvas. Later. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS344
01:08:06,00 --> 01:08:12,50
Vivian admires her son as she shakes her head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS345
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:17,50
Later, SOMEONE strolls into his room where only his twin size bed remains. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS346
01:08:22,00 --> 01:08:28,50
He gets a text from SOMEONE, I need to see you. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS347
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:41,50
Now an illuminated awning over an entry way reads, Lou's. Inside the softly lit bar, SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a booth, each with a bottle of beer on the table. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS348
01:08:40,00 --> 01:08:45,50
Her friend musters a tight smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS349
01:08:54,00 --> 01:09:00,50
SOMEONE responds with a forgiving nod. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS350
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:08,50
SOMEONE's eyes glisten and he presses his lip. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS351
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:21,50
SOMEONE gives him a grave nod. He bravely looks her in the eye. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS352
01:10:22,00 --> 01:10:27,50
SOMEONE lowers her gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS353
01:10:24,00 --> 01:10:32,50
She rubs her neck then rests her head in her hand and allows a brief sad smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS354
01:10:49,00 --> 01:10:54,50
SOMEONE looks down and bites her lips. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS355
01:10:54,00 --> 01:11:02,50
With a faint smile, she reaches out and takes his hand in hers stroking his fingers with her thumb. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS356
01:11:01,00 --> 01:11:11,50
Later as they follow the sidewalk, the young beauty casually bumps against SOMEONE, then tucks her hair behind her ear. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS357
01:11:08,00 --> 01:11:14,50
Their interlocked hands sway gently with their 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS358
01:11:11,00 --> 01:11:17,50
Now they arrive at her deserted apartment. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS359
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:23,50
They sit before laced curtained windows filled with soft golden light and kiss tenderly. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS360
01:11:22,00 --> 01:11:27,50
Pulling back SOMEONE beams at SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS361
01:11:25,00 --> 01:11:31,50
He invitingly brushes the tip of her nose with his. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS362
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:35,50
Her smile grows and she brings her lips to his again. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS363
01:11:33,00 --> 01:11:42,50
As they share a series of soft gentle kisses, her hand moves up to his shoulder. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS364
01:11:41,00 --> 01:11:52,50
Now in the soft predawn light, street lamps twinkle beyond a weathered wooden bench. SOMEONE strolls into view and takes a seat. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS365
01:11:51,00 --> 01:11:57,50
He stares off, his lips pursed in a thoughtful pout. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS366
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:03,50
Back in Charlotte's empty apartment SOMEONE pulls away abruptly and looks up at SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS367
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:18,50
SOMEONE gives her an eager kiss. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS368
01:12:22,00 --> 01:12:28,50
SOMEONE kisses him and drapes her arms around his shoulders. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS369
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:31,50
He smiles down at her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS370
01:12:38,00 --> 01:12:44,50
On the bench SOMEONE gives a hopeful smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS371
01:12:42,00 --> 01:12:47,50
He lowers his gaze and licks his lips 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS372
01:12:46,00 --> 01:12:54,50
Now, verdant tree branches dapple our view of a bright blue sky patched 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS373
01:12:51,00 --> 01:12:55,50
with wispy clouds. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS375
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:02,50
She sets a heavy backpack at her feet. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS376
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:06,50
Then slips her hands in her pockets and cranes her neck for a view up the street. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS377
01:13:04,00 --> 01:13:18,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE leaves his building with his now draped canvas tucked under one arm. His other arm curls around the massive stack of completed homework assignments as he heads down the sidewalk at a brisk pace. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS378
01:13:16,00 --> 01:13:23,50
Now, cars line up outside an international terminal at an airport. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS379
01:13:20,00 --> 01:13:29,50
A black luxury car with tinted windows pulls into view and parks at the curb. SOMEONE and SOMEONE get out. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS380
01:13:26,00 --> 01:13:42,50
The trunk pops open and they reach in for their bags. In the Principal's office SOMEONE's hands set the massive stack of assignments down on the desk. Working facing the wall, the administrator turns and looks up at SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS381
01:13:41,00 --> 01:13:46,50
He eyes the stack. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS382
01:13:52,00 --> 01:14:01,50
At the airport, SOMEONE and SOMEONE arrive at the boarding area where other passengers file through a gate. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS383
01:13:58,00 --> 01:14:07,50
The teen girl hesitates and looks around. In the art room, SOMEONE sets SOMEONE's canvas on an easel. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS384
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:14,50
He steps back, his hands on his hips and regards it shrewdly as his troubled student stands nearby. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS385
01:14:11,00 --> 01:14:17,50
The art teacher faces SOMEONE with a cocked eyebrow. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS386
01:14:14,00 --> 01:14:31,50
He shoves the boy, then envelops him in a proud embrace. The teen gives a dimpled smile as he returns the hug, then faces his work with gleaming eyes. SOMEONE puts an arm around his shoulder and looks at the painting with an appreciative scowl. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS387
01:14:32,00 --> 01:14:43,50
At the boarding gate, SOMEONE lingers by a window. Now a banner over the school entrance reads, Morgan. Congratulations, Seniors. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS388
01:14:42,00 --> 01:14:47,50
SOMEONE sits by SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS389
01:14:45,00 --> 01:14:50,50
He shakes his head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS390
01:14:55,00 --> 01:15:03,50
On her other side SOMEONE stands, goes to the stage and shakes the Principal's hand. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS391
01:15:03,00 --> 01:15:09,50
The teen takes his diploma and executes a groovy spin. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS392
01:15:07,00 --> 01:15:20,50
SOMEONE chuckles fondly and SOMEONE laughs into her hand. They briefly share a smile. At the boarding gate, SOMEONE checks with a ticket agent then joins SOMEONE at the sun lit window. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS393
01:15:33,00 --> 01:15:42,50
With a fond smirk SOMEONE steps closer, cradles her head in his hands and gives her a tender kiss. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS394
01:15:39,00 --> 01:15:58,50
SOMEONE briefly averts her gaze then flashes a wan smile. SOMEONE kisses her again. At graduation, SOMEONE's expression grows pensive. At the airport SOMEONE lowers her gaze then smiles at SOMEONE again. At school, SOMEONE notices SOMEONE's tense demeanor. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS395
01:16:07,00 --> 01:16:13,50
SOMEONE beams warmly at him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS396
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:40,50
The principal leans over the podium looking straight at him. SOMEONE lifts his gaze, his hazel eyes gleaming. In slow motion he stands and makes his way to the stage. SOMEONE and SOMEONE grin after him. His mother beams happily. As he reaches the stage SOMEONE winks at him. SOMEONE regards him proudly. His math teacher gives a delighted round of applause and his English teacher nods approvingly. The Principal meets him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS397
01:16:41,00 --> 01:16:47,50
Smiling faintly he shakes SOMEONE's hand then leans in. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS398
01:16:47,00 --> 01:16:59,50
He holds out SOMEONE's diploma. As the teen accepts it the Principal pats him on the arm and steps away. SOMEONE smiles after him appreciatively. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS399
01:16:56,00 --> 01:17:21,50
As he faces the audience, sunlight flares in brightly through a window behind him. His mother beams proudly, her eyes glistening. The teen scans the room. Elsewhere SOMEONE turns, her surroundings washed out by sunlight. At graduation, SOMEONE's eyes shine as he lingers on the stage. Outside, tree branches bordering the streets sway gently in a breeze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS400
01:17:19,00 --> 01:17:27,50
At the school a teen girl comes outside in her cap and gown and joins two fellow graduates. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS401
01:17:30,00 --> 01:17:41,50
In the art room, SOMEONE stands with his graduation robe slung over one arm. On the easel, his painting offers a portrait of SOMEONE in 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS402
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:42,50
tints of green and purple. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS403
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:52,50
The subject gazes off with a stoic expression hinting at wisdom beyond her years. Turning away, SOMEONE sets his diploma and graduation robes on a chair. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS404
01:17:49,00 --> 01:18:02,50
As he turns back he halts and stares. In the doorway SOMEONE stands with her hands clasped before her. She offers a little smile and he regards her with shining eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS405
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:08,50
The teen girl enters the room holding SOMEONE in a solemn gaze. SOMEONE's eyes follow her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS406
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:13,50
As she passes obliviously behind her own portrait, moving with slow deliberate steps, 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS407
01:18:10,00 --> 01:18:14,50
she keeps her gaze on him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS408
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:30,50
Approaching the young artist, she regards the portrait appraisingly then tilts her head and smiles. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS409
01:18:27,00 --> 01:18:34,50
SOMEONE glances at the painting then eyes SOMEONE anxiously. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS411
01:18:37,00 --> 01:18:47,50
SOMEONE's gaze cools and his smile vanishes. She joins him at his side then faces the portrait again. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS412
01:18:48,00 --> 01:18:55,50
She looks up at him with a teasing smirk. SOMEONE beams understandingly. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS413
01:18:53,00 --> 01:18:58,50
His hand reaches out taking a gentle hold of SOMEONE. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS414
01:18:56,00 --> 01:19:03,50
As they linger facing the painting together she glances at him fondly. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS415
01:19:06,00 --> 01:19:15,50
SOMEONE heaves a grave sigh. She faces SOMEONE intently then looks back at the painting. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS416
01:19:13,00 --> 01:19:26,50
The two teens hesitantly met each other's gaze. SOMEONE yields a coy smile and turns toward the painting. SOMEONE follows her example with a hopeful gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS34
00:02:42,00 --> 00:02:47,50
Headlights glow behind them. 

THE_VOW_DVS35
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:49,50
The couple kisses passionately. 

THE_VOW_DVS37
00:02:52,00 --> 00:03:01,50
The driver side window shatters. The slipping truck veers right, and the pushed car slams into something. 

THE_VOW_DVS38
00:02:58,00 --> 00:03:06,50
Still seen in slow motion the brunette woman appears weightless as she drifts headfirst toward the windshield. 

THE_VOW_DVS40
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:11,50
It shatters on contact. She lands halfway outside, face down on the hood. 

THE_VOW_DVS41
00:03:09,00 --> 00:03:18,50
The front bumpers crushed against a utility pole.  

THE_VOW_DVS45
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:35,50
Later, emergency personnel wheel the unconscious couple into a hospital on stretchers. 

THE_VOW_DVS46
00:03:32,00 --> 00:03:37,50
Words appear. Inspired by true events. 

THE_VOW_DVS47
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:42,50
In the ER a doctor intubates the wife while another cuts the husband's shirt. 

THE_VOW_DVS48
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:49,50
In a corridor, three guys and two women anxiously heed the words of a nurse. The husband briefly opens his eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS49
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:01,50
Four years ago. 

THE_VOW_DVS50
00:03:58,00 --> 00:04:04,50
In a government building the broad shouldered man waits in line. 

THE_VOW_DVS51
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:10,50
He sees his future wife with dark chin length hair leaving the counter ahead of him. 

THE_VOW_DVS52
00:04:07,00 --> 00:04:13,50
As she passes, he glances after her. Their gazes meet. 

THE_VOW_DVS53
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:19,50
They share a smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS54
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:22,50
Now he catches up with her, wearing a hip straw fedora. 

THE_VOW_DVS55
00:04:20,00 --> 00:04:25,50
She turns and finds him right there. 

THE_VOW_DVS56
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:28,50
He holds it out. 

THE_VOW_DVS57
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:36,50
He notices a sticker on her car. 

THE_VOW_DVS58
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:46,50
She smiles, he drops his gaze and grins sheepishly. 

THE_VOW_DVS59
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:56,50
She opens her car door. 

THE_VOW_DVS60
00:05:19,00 --> 00:05:23,50
She looks him in the eye. 

THE_VOW_DVS61
00:05:36,00 --> 00:05:41,50
Considering, she allows an amused smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS62
00:05:41,00 --> 00:05:46,50
She nods and he grins brightly. 

THE_VOW_DVS63
00:05:45,00 --> 00:05:51,50
She closes her driver side door and triggers her keychain remote. 

THE_VOW_DVS64
00:05:50,00 --> 00:05:56,50
Later in a dine-in spot called SOMEONE Mnemonic, 

THE_VOW_DVS65
00:05:53,00 --> 00:05:59,50
SOMEONE hides two chocolates from a box behind his back. 

THE_VOW_DVS66
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:06,50
They each take a bite from a chocolate. 

THE_VOW_DVS67
00:06:05,00 --> 00:06:10,50
She offers her glass of red wine. 

THE_VOW_DVS68
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:15,50
As he takes a sip, she plucks the straw fedora off his head and tries it on herself. 

THE_VOW_DVS69
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:22,50
He tweaks the brim lower on her brow, and she wipes chocolate off his mouth. 

THE_VOW_DVS70
00:06:20,00 --> 00:06:29,50
At another SOMEONE, a pale and red-nosed SOMEONE shrugs her open sweater onto her shoulders and serves drinks. 

THE_VOW_DVS71
00:06:26,00 --> 00:06:32,50
She frowns at a box left on a table by a window. 

THE_VOW_DVS72
00:06:29,00 --> 00:06:35,50
She wipes her nose with a tissue, then heads over. 

THE_VOW_DVS73
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:37,50
Finding a photo of herself on the box's lid, 

THE_VOW_DVS74
00:06:35,00 --> 00:06:42,50
she lifts her gaze and sees her handsome companion standing outside in the pouring rain. 

THE_VOW_DVS75
00:06:40,00 --> 00:06:45,50
He gestures and she opens the gift. 

THE_VOW_DVS76
00:06:43,00 --> 00:06:48,50
She reads a note on a box of tissues. 

THE_VOW_DVS77
00:06:46,00 --> 00:06:50,50
She finds medicine. 

THE_VOW_DVS78
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:54,50
She takes out a photo of SOMEONE holding a guitar. 

THE_VOW_DVS79
00:06:53,00 --> 00:07:01,50
Holding his gaze, she presses the photo to her chest. Finding another note, she reads. 

THE_VOW_DVS80
00:06:59,00 --> 00:07:07,50
She pulls out a sexy lingerie bask with a black laced trimmed bust. 

THE_VOW_DVS81
00:07:04,00 --> 00:07:11,50
Holding it up, she purses her lips and mocks a seductive expression. 

THE_VOW_DVS82
00:07:08,00 --> 00:07:12,50
SOMEONE grins. 

THE_VOW_DVS83
00:07:09,00 --> 00:07:15,50
SOMEONE glances around, then hurriedly lowers the lingerie. 

THE_VOW_DVS84
00:07:13,00 --> 00:07:18,50
With a wave, SOMEONE heads away. 

THE_VOW_DVS85
00:07:15,00 --> 00:07:22,50
SOMEONE’s reflection in the window shows her loving smile as she waves back. 

THE_VOW_DVS87
00:07:21,00 --> 00:07:28,50
SOMEONE holds an arm out of a car window, as SOMEONE drives. She tickles him. 

THE_VOW_DVS88
00:07:27,00 --> 00:07:33,50
His eyes squint merrily as he leans back laughing. 

THE_VOW_DVS89
00:07:31,00 --> 00:07:39,50
SOMEONE beams at him, SOMEONE’s grin wilts and he clenches his jaw. SOMEONE stares. 

THE_VOW_DVS90
00:07:43,00 --> 00:07:51,50
With a smile, SOMEONE hits a switch. As she puts her power window up she holds SOMEONE’s gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS91
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:07,50
In the present, a CT machine scans an unconscious SOMEONE.  

THE_VOW_DVS94
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:41,50
At his wife’s bedside, 

THE_VOW_DVS95
00:08:38,00 --> 00:08:45,50
he returns her wedding ring to her finger. A ventilator tube juts from her mouth.  

THE_VOW_DVS96
00:08:53,00 --> 00:09:02,50
In a flashback, SOMEONE exits an apartment and finds her in an alley. 

THE_VOW_DVS97
00:09:00,00 --> 00:09:04,50
She feeds a stray cat. 

THE_VOW_DVS98
00:09:04,00 --> 00:09:08,50
She heads inside. 

THE_VOW_DVS99
00:09:16,00 --> 00:09:20,50
SOMEONE’s three guy friends join them. 

THE_VOW_DVS100
00:09:40,00 --> 00:09:46,50
SOMEONE serves her pancakes with words spelled in blueberries. 

THE_VOW_DVS101
00:09:47,00 --> 00:09:54,50
He adjusts a few berries, clarifying the message, Move in, with a question SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS102
00:09:51,00 --> 00:09:57,50
SOMEONE beams and SOMEONE’s guy friends swap happy looks. 

THE_VOW_DVS103
00:09:56,00 --> 00:10:00,50
She kisses SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS104
00:09:58,00 --> 00:10:03,50
Now SOMEONE wears a wedding veil. 

THE_VOW_DVS105
00:10:15,00 --> 00:10:20,50
They stand with friends in a gallery. 

THE_VOW_DVS106
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:48,50
He takes out his vows. Grinning, SOMEONE shows her identical SOMEONE Mnemonic menu. SOMEONE’s guy friends, a brunette woman with a beauty SOMEONE and a few others witness the event. 

THE_VOW_DVS107
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:19,50
Beaming, SOMEONE nods. Their friends smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS108
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:34,50
Their officiating friend spots two guards. 

THE_VOW_DVS109
00:11:37,00 --> 00:11:46,50
The newlyweds share a quick kiss, then flee the museum gallery with their small group of friends. The guards chase them. 

THE_VOW_DVS110
00:11:43,00 --> 00:11:52,50
Hurrying up a flight of stairs, SOMEONE drops his SOMEONE Mnemonic menu and pauses to snatch it up. 

THE_VOW_DVS111
00:11:49,00 --> 00:11:56,50
Outside, he holds SOMEONE’s hand as they race across a footbridge. 

THE_VOW_DVS112
00:11:53,00 --> 00:11:57,50
The guards give up the chase. 

THE_VOW_DVS113
00:11:55,00 --> 00:12:01,50
A sign below reads, The Art Institute of Chicago. 

THE_VOW_DVS115
00:11:59,00 --> 00:12:06,50
In Millennium Park, SOMEONE and SOMEONE kiss under the steel, bean shaped archway of cloud gate. 

THE_VOW_DVS116
00:12:03,00 --> 00:12:11,50
A wider view shows people strolling the plaza around the 40-foot high sculpture. 

THE_VOW_DVS117
00:12:08,00 --> 00:12:16,50
Their warped figures reflected on its seamless, chrome like surface. In another flashback, 

THE_VOW_DVS118
00:12:13,00 --> 00:12:20,50
SOMEONE works a mound of clay on the table in an art studio. 

THE_VOW_DVS119
00:12:17,00 --> 00:12:22,50
Her pulled back hair is now shoulder length. 

THE_VOW_DVS120
00:12:20,00 --> 00:12:27,50
With a frustrated look, she smacks the unfinished sculpture, then shoves the table away. 

THE_VOW_DVS121
00:12:26,00 --> 00:12:31,50
SOMEONE enters and turns off the stereo. 

THE_VOW_DVS122
00:12:32,00 --> 00:12:37,50
SOMEONE stomps irritably. 

THE_VOW_DVS123
00:12:52,00 --> 00:12:58,50
SOMEONE holds up a piece of clay, shaped like a person. 

THE_VOW_DVS124
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:02,50
He makes the tiny figure dance. 

THE_VOW_DVS125
00:13:02,00 --> 00:13:07,50
SOMEONE playfully bites her neck. 

THE_VOW_DVS126
00:13:07,00 --> 00:13:14,50
He tickles her sides and she sinks to the floor in the fetal position. 

THE_VOW_DVS127
00:13:15,00 --> 00:13:20,50
He eyes clay on a table. 

THE_VOW_DVS128
00:13:39,00 --> 00:13:45,50
Nodding, SOMEONE gives him a tender smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS129
00:13:54,00 --> 00:13:59,50
She points at a different table. 

THE_VOW_DVS130
00:13:58,00 --> 00:14:03,50
She eyes the subject of his commentary. 

THE_VOW_DVS131
00:14:04,00 --> 00:14:11,50
Grinning, she cups his face in her hands and presses her lips to his abashed smirk. 

THE_VOW_DVS132
00:14:08,00 --> 00:14:15,50
As they kiss, she lies back on the floor, pulling him down on top of her. 

THE_VOW_DVS133
00:14:13,00 --> 00:14:18,50
He brushes his fingers over her hair, 

THE_VOW_DVS135
00:14:17,00 --> 00:14:23,50
then lowers his lips to her neck. 

THE_VOW_DVS136
00:14:20,00 --> 00:14:24,50
She pulls up his shirt to reveal his toned back, and works it over his head. 

THE_VOW_DVS139
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:34,50
His fingers move to the buttons on her top. 

THE_VOW_DVS140
00:14:31,00 --> 00:14:37,50
Sunlight glows through the studio windows as SOMEONE lies asleep face down on SOMEONE’s chest. A rumpled sheet covers their waists. 

THE_VOW_DVS141
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:40,50
SOMEONE stirs and caresses his wife’s arm with his thumb. 

THE_VOW_DVS142
00:14:49,00 --> 00:14:56,50
In the present, SOMEONE breaths with a nasal cannula as she lies in bed. 

THE_VOW_DVS143
00:14:53,00 --> 00:14:59,50
Wound scars barely show on the right side of her face. 

THE_VOW_DVS144
00:15:05,00 --> 00:15:11,50
SOMEONE stands with SOMEONE’s doctor at the foot of the bed. 

THE_VOW_DVS145
00:15:08,00 --> 00:15:15,50
The brunette shifts her groggy gaze, then closes her eyes and winces. 

THE_VOW_DVS146
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:17,50
SOMEONE’s eyes grow misty. 

THE_VOW_DVS147
00:15:32,00 --> 00:15:37,50
SOMEONE gives him an uncertain look. 

THE_VOW_DVS148
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:40,50
SOMEONE turns to the doctor. 

THE_VOW_DVS149
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:49,50
SOMEONE addresses the question to SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS150
00:15:48,00 --> 00:15:53,50
He shoots her doctor a glance. 

THE_VOW_DVS151
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:55,50
SOMEONE eyes him expectantly. 

THE_VOW_DVS152
00:15:58,00 --> 00:16:05,50
The real doctor turns to SOMEONE who returns a nonplussed glance. 

THE_VOW_DVS153
00:16:06,00 --> 00:16:14,50
The physician watches as SOMEONE’s distressed husband takes a seat at his wife’s bedside. 

THE_VOW_DVS154
00:16:12,00 --> 00:16:19,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE with perplexed eyes, and he meets her gaze solemnly. 

THE_VOW_DVS155
00:16:17,00 --> 00:16:21,50
She glances away. 

THE_VOW_DVS156
00:16:24,00 --> 00:16:30,50
He touches her arm, but she pulls it back with an alarmed look. 

THE_VOW_DVS157
00:16:28,00 --> 00:16:33,50
SOMEONE drops his dejected gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS158
00:16:30,00 --> 00:16:35,50
The doctor observes closely. 

THE_VOW_DVS159
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:39,50
SOMEONE lifts her hand and stares at the gold rope designed wedding ring on her finger. 

THE_VOW_DVS160
00:16:36,00 --> 00:16:41,50
She shifts her shocked eyes to SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS161
00:16:41,00 --> 00:16:45,50
Now he exits to the hall. 

THE_VOW_DVS162
00:17:03,00 --> 00:17:08,50
He storms off. 

THE_VOW_DVS163
00:17:05,00 --> 00:17:13,50
Now in a corridor, SOMEONE paces by a vending machine, clenching and unclenching his fists. 

THE_VOW_DVS164
00:17:10,00 --> 00:17:14,50
He leans against the machine. 

THE_VOW_DVS165
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:23,50
With his back against it, he sinks to the floor. 

THE_VOW_DVS166
00:17:27,00 --> 00:17:34,50
He touches the wedding band around his finger, then wrings his hands. 

THE_VOW_DVS168
00:17:32,00 --> 00:17:38,50
SOMEONE enters a waiting room and finds SOMEONE asleep on a couch. 

THE_VOW_DVS169
00:17:35,00 --> 00:17:40,50
She pokes his shoulder with one finger. 

THE_VOW_DVS170
00:17:40,00 --> 00:17:45,50
Waking, he hurriedly sits up and rubs his face. 

THE_VOW_DVS171
00:17:47,00 --> 00:17:52,50
She flashes a nervous grin. 

THE_VOW_DVS172
00:18:03,00 --> 00:18:08,50
Smiling he collects his belongings. 

THE_VOW_DVS173
00:18:07,00 --> 00:18:11,50
He takes her to the cafeteria. 

THE_VOW_DVS174
00:18:39,00 --> 00:18:43,50
SOMEONE frowns dubiously. 

THE_VOW_DVS175
00:19:02,00 --> 00:19:06,50
SOMEONE shifts her shocked gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS176
00:19:07,00 --> 00:19:14,50
She moves down the serving line. Now, SOMEONE’s friends visit at the hospital. 

THE_VOW_DVS177
00:19:15,00 --> 00:19:20,50
A guy throws a packaged salad at another. 

THE_VOW_DVS179
00:19:42,00 --> 00:19:48,50
The girl with the beauty SOMEONE crouches in front of SOMEONE and looks up at him. 

THE_VOW_DVS180
00:19:57,00 --> 00:20:01,50
SOMEONE gazes downward. 

THE_VOW_DVS182
00:19:59,00 --> 00:20:07,50
he reclines in the large, industrial room, serving as his and SOMEONE’s trendy Bohemian apartment. 

THE_VOW_DVS183
00:20:05,00 --> 00:20:13,50
Now, he arrives in the recovery ward with a tote bag and strides cheerfully to SOMEONE’s curtained off bed. 

THE_VOW_DVS184
00:20:11,00 --> 00:20:15,50
Pulling the curtains aside, 

THE_VOW_DVS185
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:18,50
he finds the bed crisply made and unoccupied. 

THE_VOW_DVS186
00:20:17,00 --> 00:20:21,50
He goes to the nurse’s station. 

THE_VOW_DVS187
00:20:32,00 --> 00:20:38,50
Leaving the recovery area, SOMEONE breaks into a run. 

THE_VOW_DVS188
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:40,50
Now in a comfortable private suite, 

THE_VOW_DVS189
00:20:47,00 --> 00:20:53,50
an elegant older couple regards SOMEONE coldly. 

THE_VOW_DVS190
00:21:33,00 --> 00:21:37,50
SOMEONE’s mother kisses her hand. 

THE_VOW_DVS191
00:22:15,00 --> 00:22:19,50
In the cafeteria. 

THE_VOW_DVS192
00:22:32,00 --> 00:22:37,50
SOMEONE meets her gaze reluctantly. 

THE_VOW_DVS193
00:22:58,00 --> 00:23:02,50
SOMEONE hangs his head. 

THE_VOW_DVS194
00:23:05,00 --> 00:23:10,50
SOMEONE leaves the table and he gestures helplessly. 

THE_VOW_DVS195
00:23:09,00 --> 00:23:14,50
Standing he gathers their things. 

THE_VOW_DVS196
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:57,50
SOMEONE shrugs and shakes her head. 

THE_VOW_DVS197
00:23:55,00 --> 00:23:59,50
She moves off. 

THE_VOW_DVS198
00:23:56,00 --> 00:24:02,50
SOMEONE briefly hangs his head then takes a deep breath. 

THE_VOW_DVS199
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:08,50
Now SOMEONE enters the VIP recovery room, clad in a short crocheted sweater dress and boots. 

THE_VOW_DVS200
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:21,50
Her doctor arrives. 

THE_VOW_DVS201
00:24:22,00 --> 00:24:27,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE runs through the hospital. 

THE_VOW_DVS202
00:24:40,00 --> 00:24:44,50
SOMEONE hurries in. 

THE_VOW_DVS203
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:16,50
Her brow knitted, SOMEONE blinks at SOMEONE. He lowers the phone. 

THE_VOW_DVS204
00:25:45,00 --> 00:25:51,50
SOMEONE stares at him, her gaze softening. 

THE_VOW_DVS205
00:25:59,00 --> 00:26:06,50
Lowering her thoughtful eyes, SOMEONE puffs her cheeks out then exhales. 

THE_VOW_DVS206
00:26:08,00 --> 00:26:12,50
Her parents glower. 

THE_VOW_DVS207
00:26:24,00 --> 00:26:29,50
SOMEONE fixes his fond eyes on his wife. 

THE_VOW_DVS208
00:26:27,00 --> 00:26:37,50
Now, as he drives her through the city, SOMEONE faces her side view mirror. She briefly lifts her bangs back and studies the scar at her hairline. 

THE_VOW_DVS209
00:26:40,00 --> 00:26:48,50
Noting her husband’s earnest expression, SOMEONE yields a shy smile. An elevated train passes nearby. 

THE_VOW_DVS210
00:26:48,00 --> 00:26:53,50
SOMEONE smiles wistfully. 

THE_VOW_DVS211
00:27:06,00 --> 00:27:12,50
SOMEONE averts her surprised, slack-jawed gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS212
00:27:09,00 --> 00:27:16,50
At night, SOMEONE shuts her door for her as she gets out of his 80s era Wagoneer. 

THE_VOW_DVS213
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:19,50
He shyly walks her to their apartment’s entrance. 

THE_VOW_DVS214
00:27:21,00 --> 00:27:27,50
He leads her in to a foyer, then gestures. 

THE_VOW_DVS215
00:27:25,00 --> 00:27:33,50
As he shuts the door and carries their things, SOMEONE wrings her hands and ventures warily into the living room. 

THE_VOW_DVS216
00:27:33,00 --> 00:27:40,50
SOMEONE’s eyes widen. The girl with the beauty SOMEONE hugs her. 

THE_VOW_DVS217
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:55,50
The lovely woman recovers her smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS218
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:00,50
The wedding officiant. 

THE_VOW_DVS219
00:28:10,00 --> 00:28:17,50
As SOMEONE hurries off, SOMEONE watches her go. SOMEONE follows his wife. 

THE_VOW_DVS220
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:19,50
Later, the guests file out. 

THE_VOW_DVS221
00:28:20,00 --> 00:28:27,50
SOMEONE sees off a trendy couple, then withdraws into the apartment and shuts the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS222
00:28:25,00 --> 00:28:33,50
At a dressing table, SOMEONE’s fingers glide over a drawing of a reclined female figure in a sketchbook. 

THE_VOW_DVS223
00:28:31,00 --> 00:28:36,50
Quaint odds and ends litter the surface. 

THE_VOW_DVS224
00:28:33,00 --> 00:28:42,50
SOMEONE’s reflections shows in a small round mirror trimmed along the bottom with photos and illustrations. 

THE_VOW_DVS225
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:45,50
She picks up a bottle of perfume, and gives it a sniff. 

THE_VOW_DVS226
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:49,50
SOMEONE approaches and sits in a nearby armchair. 

THE_VOW_DVS227
00:29:32,00 --> 00:29:37,50
Her gaze anguished, SOMEONE shuts her eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS228
00:29:47,00 --> 00:29:51,50
SOMEONE gets up and leaves the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS230
00:29:50,00 --> 00:29:56,50
Staring ahead, SOMEONE’s features twist in a remorseful SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS231
00:29:54,00 --> 00:30:01,50
In the living room, a shirtless SOMEONE covers his bare feet with a nappy blanket 

THE_VOW_DVS232
00:29:58,00 --> 00:30:03,50
and curls up beneath it on a couch. 

THE_VOW_DVS233
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:05,50
SOMEONE remains at the dressing table. 

THE_VOW_DVS234
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:09,50
She props her chin on her fist. 

THE_VOW_DVS235
00:30:07,00 --> 00:30:14,50
An artfully made, queen sized bed lies unoccupied behind her. 

THE_VOW_DVS236
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:17,50
On the couch, SOMEONE stares off with a melancholy gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS237
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:21,50
Now, the sun shines brightly outside their converted warehouse building. 

THE_VOW_DVS238
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:27,50
Inside a framed photo of a shirtless SOMEONE stands beside a baroque vanity mirror painted yellow. 

THE_VOW_DVS239
00:30:24,00 --> 00:30:33,50
The frame of a much larger wall mirror is home to several more candids, lovingly tucked in place. 

THE_VOW_DVS240
00:30:30,00 --> 00:30:36,50
SOMEONE approaches in a towel and spies a photo of her tattooed back. 

THE_VOW_DVS241
00:30:35,00 --> 00:30:42,50
She anxiously locates the swirling crescent shaped fish tattoo on her actual back. 

THE_VOW_DVS242
00:30:45,00 --> 00:30:50,50
SOMEONE steps away from the mirror. 

THE_VOW_DVS243
00:30:47,00 --> 00:30:53,50
On the living room couch, SOMEONE stirs groggily and wakes. 

THE_VOW_DVS244
00:30:51,00 --> 00:30:55,50
He sits up and throws off the blanket. 

THE_VOW_DVS245
00:30:53,00 --> 00:30:58,50
He rests his elbows on his knees, 

THE_VOW_DVS246
00:30:55,00 --> 00:31:01,50
then stands and plods bare bottomed across the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS247
00:30:59,00 --> 00:31:06,50
As SOMEONE puts on a bra, her naked husband straggles by, rubbing his eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS248
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:19,50
SOMEONE cracks up. 

THE_VOW_DVS249
00:31:22,00 --> 00:31:28,50
Smiling, SOMEONE shuts himself in an adjacent bathroom. 

THE_VOW_DVS250
00:31:26,00 --> 00:31:34,50
Now, a door opens to reveal SOMEONE wearing a Chicago Cubs sweatshirt and a sporty ponytail. 

THE_VOW_DVS251
00:31:32,00 --> 00:31:36,50
She enters the kitchen. 

THE_VOW_DVS252
00:31:33,00 --> 00:31:38,50
Sitting at the island, SOMEONE beams at her. 

THE_VOW_DVS253
00:31:46,00 --> 00:31:50,50
She opens a cabinet. 

THE_VOW_DVS254
00:31:53,00 --> 00:32:00,50
SOMEONE continues through the kitchen, opening the high cabinets one at a time. 

THE_VOW_DVS255
00:31:57,00 --> 00:32:02,50
SOMEONE watches her intently. 

THE_VOW_DVS256
00:31:59,00 --> 00:32:03,50
She notices. 

THE_VOW_DVS257
00:32:11,00 --> 00:32:17,50
SOMEONE notices fresh fruit, coffee, and French toast on the island. 

THE_VOW_DVS258
00:32:25,00 --> 00:32:30,50
SOMEONE sits at a place setting. 

THE_VOW_DVS259
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:37,50
SOMEONE nods and sets down a newspaper. 

THE_VOW_DVS260
00:32:40,00 --> 00:32:45,50
SOMEONE shrugs inquisitively. 

THE_VOW_DVS261
00:32:47,00 --> 00:32:53,50
SOMEONE bites his lip and stifles a boyish smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS262
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:55,50
SOMEONE nods demurely. 

THE_VOW_DVS263
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:11,50
As SOMEONE gets the coffee pot his wife bites into a strip of bacon. 

THE_VOW_DVS264
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:17,50
SOMEONE stares at the bacon. 

THE_VOW_DVS265
00:33:15,00 --> 00:33:20,50
She sets it down and picks bacon bits off her tongue. 

THE_VOW_DVS266
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:12,50
SOMEONE steps toward his wife, hesitates, and pats her back. 

THE_VOW_DVS267
00:34:10,00 --> 00:34:14,50
He heads for the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS268
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:18,50
Going out, he glances at her repeatedly. 

THE_VOW_DVS269
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:22,50
SOMEONE offers a small wave and he shuts the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS270
00:34:20,00 --> 00:34:26,50
Left alone, she bites into a strip of bacon. 

THE_VOW_DVS271
00:34:23,00 --> 00:34:32,50
Now SOMEONE’s Wagoneer pulls up outside a converted garage with corrugated metal walls and a red door. 

THE_VOW_DVS272
00:34:29,00 --> 00:34:35,50
Inside, SOMEONE works at a soundboard. 

THE_VOW_DVS273
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:38,50
SOMEONE comes in and deposits his things near the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS274
00:35:27,00 --> 00:35:32,50
SOMEONE hangs his head unhappily. 

THE_VOW_DVS275
00:35:58,00 --> 00:36:07,50
At the apartment, SOMEONE slides aside a grated door, protecting shelves of records, books, and DVDs. 

THE_VOW_DVS276
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:13,50
She finds a sticky note from SOMEONE attached to one disc’s box. It reads More Evidence. 

THE_VOW_DVS277
00:36:12,00 --> 00:36:16,50
She winces as she watches. 

THE_VOW_DVS278
00:36:28,00 --> 00:36:33,50
SOMEONE laughs at her recorded comment. 

THE_VOW_DVS279
00:36:35,00 --> 00:36:40,50
In the video, SOMEONE holds up her menu. 

THE_VOW_DVS280
00:37:01,00 --> 00:37:06,50
SOMEONE sorrowfully covers her mouth. 

THE_VOW_DVS281
00:37:03,00 --> 00:37:10,50
Later, she clutches a hard-covered book to her chest, as she strides into SOMEONE Mnemonic. 

THE_VOW_DVS282
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:15,50
Crouching in front of a display case, she eyes shelves of pastries, then straightens. 

THE_VOW_DVS283
00:37:21,00 --> 00:37:25,50
She points, 

THE_VOW_DVS284
00:37:30,00 --> 00:37:36,50
she grins. Now she exits with her purchase. 

THE_VOW_DVS285
00:37:36,00 --> 00:37:42,50
At a store across the street, SOMEONE pays a florist. 

THE_VOW_DVS286
00:37:39,00 --> 00:37:48,50
Outside SOMEONE Mnemonic, SOMEONE glances around without seeing him, then heads down a sidewalk. 

THE_VOW_DVS287
00:37:45,00 --> 00:37:51,50
SOMEONE takes his bouquet of flowers and hurries in another direction. 

THE_VOW_DVS288
00:37:49,00 --> 00:37:57,50
Later, SOMEONE stands by a stairway to an L-train platform and looks around in confusion. 

THE_VOW_DVS289
00:37:54,00 --> 00:37:59,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE arrives at their apartment. 

THE_VOW_DVS290
00:37:59,00 --> 00:38:07,50
Elsewhere in the city, SOMEONE stands at a bustling intersection and blinks her frustrated eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS292
00:38:06,00 --> 00:38:12,50
At the apartment, SOMEONE spots his wife’s cellphone left on the kitchen island. He picks it up and checks its display, 

THE_VOW_DVS293
00:38:09,00 --> 00:38:15,50
then heads outside. 

THE_VOW_DVS294
00:38:14,00 --> 00:38:19,50
On the sidewalk out front, he glances around, then breaks into a run. 

THE_VOW_DVS297
00:38:20,00 --> 00:38:26,50
SOMEONE enters a restaurant equipment store and approaches a worker at a counter. 

THE_VOW_DVS298
00:38:28,00 --> 00:38:33,50
SOMEONE continues his search. 

THE_VOW_DVS299
00:38:39,00 --> 00:38:45,50
Now a car pulls up in front of SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS300
00:38:46,00 --> 00:38:50,50
Her mother beckons. 

THE_VOW_DVS301
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:54,50
Climbing into the convertible Mercedes, SOMEONE hugs her. 

THE_VOW_DVS302
00:38:53,00 --> 00:38:57,50
They drive off. 

THE_VOW_DVS303
00:38:54,00 --> 00:39:02,50
Later at the apartment, SOMEONE waits in the living room area and anxiously rubs his head. 

THE_VOW_DVS304
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:07,50
SOMEONE arrives wearing a classy, contemporary dress and a half sleeved cardigan. 

THE_VOW_DVS306
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:09,50
SOMEONE strides over. 

THE_VOW_DVS307
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:46,50
SOMEONE gives a helpless shrug. 

THE_VOW_DVS308
00:39:53,00 --> 00:39:59,50
SOMEONE bows his head then meets her imploring gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS309
00:40:03,00 --> 00:40:08,50
SOMEONE trudges out of the kitchen. 

THE_VOW_DVS310
00:40:12,00 --> 00:40:17,50
Later he drives her through an upscale neighborhood. 

THE_VOW_DVS311
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:28,50
She holds the bouquet he purchased. 

THE_VOW_DVS312
00:40:36,00 --> 00:40:40,50
SOMEONE blinks. 

THE_VOW_DVS313
00:40:39,00 --> 00:40:43,50
She mulls it over. 

THE_VOW_DVS314
00:40:43,00 --> 00:40:48,50
They approach a Tudor style house. 

THE_VOW_DVS315
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:06,50
Now in a dining room, SOMEONE casually displays a ring on her finger. 

THE_VOW_DVS316
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:41,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE who mouths, It’s okay. 

THE_VOW_DVS317
00:41:40,00 --> 00:41:46,50
Already seated, SOMEONE stands awkwardly, then sits again. 

THE_VOW_DVS318
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:12,50
SOMEONE raises his glass with the others. 

THE_VOW_DVS319
00:42:21,00 --> 00:42:26,50
SOMEONE gives a wry look. 

THE_VOW_DVS320
00:42:24,00 --> 00:42:31,50
SOMEONE eyes her lovingly, and she twitches an uneasy smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS321
00:42:43,00 --> 00:42:47,50
SOMEONE nods equivocating. 

THE_VOW_DVS322
00:42:47,00 --> 00:42:51,50
SOMEONE gives her fiancé a look. 

THE_VOW_DVS323
00:43:30,00 --> 00:43:36,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare at him with blank expressions. 

THE_VOW_DVS324
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:39,50
SOMEONE gives a puzzled shrug. 

THE_VOW_DVS325
00:43:39,00 --> 00:43:45,50
Later, patrons queue up outside a chic bar. 

THE_VOW_DVS326
00:43:42,00 --> 00:43:48,50
Entering, SOMEONE and SOMEONE trail behind SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS327
00:43:51,00 --> 00:43:57,50
SOMEONE waves at a blonde, who averts her gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS328
00:43:56,00 --> 00:44:01,50
SOMEONE glances over. 

THE_VOW_DVS329
00:44:02,00 --> 00:44:06,50
They reach a table. 

THE_VOW_DVS330
00:44:05,00 --> 00:44:09,50
Three women greet them. 

THE_VOW_DVS331
00:44:08,00 --> 00:44:13,50
SOMEONE slaps SOMEONE on the back. 

THE_VOW_DVS332
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:15,50
SOMEONE observes the group, tentatively. 

THE_VOW_DVS333
00:44:22,00 --> 00:44:27,50
Turning, SOMEONE stares with an enamored look. 

THE_VOW_DVS334
00:44:27,00 --> 00:44:33,50
A clean-cut blonde man in a suit holds her gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS335
00:44:48,00 --> 00:44:53,50
SOMEONE smirks. 

THE_VOW_DVS336
00:44:57,00 --> 00:45:04,50
SOMEONE smiles at SOMEONE who gives SOMEONE a haughty glance on his way to the bar. 

THE_VOW_DVS337
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:21,50
As the reunited friends chat, SOMEONE stands awkwardly apart. 

THE_VOW_DVS338
00:45:18,00 --> 00:45:23,50
Later, at his recording studio. 

THE_VOW_DVS339
00:45:44,00 --> 00:45:49,50
SOMEONE frowns dizzily. 

THE_VOW_DVS340
00:45:48,00 --> 00:45:52,50
Now they sit outside. 

THE_VOW_DVS341
00:46:07,00 --> 00:46:12,50
SOMEONE glances over, then shrugs. 

THE_VOW_DVS342
00:46:30,00 --> 00:46:35,50
SOMEONE stares off thoughtfully. 

THE_VOW_DVS343
00:46:33,00 --> 00:46:43,50
Now, an L-train trundles over a bridge. Riding on board, SOMEONE glances out her window, as her train crosses an intersecting rail line. 

THE_VOW_DVS344
00:46:41,00 --> 00:46:49,50
Later, elevator doors open and she strides past a reception desk in an upscale office. 

THE_VOW_DVS345
00:46:52,00 --> 00:46:59,50
SOMEONE finds SOMEONE on the phone in his office. They swap a wave. 

THE_VOW_DVS346
00:47:02,00 --> 00:47:08,50
Facing his ex, he grins from ear to ear. 

THE_VOW_DVS347
00:47:08,00 --> 00:47:14,50
He gestures cordially, and SOMEONE takes a seat in front of his desk. 

THE_VOW_DVS348
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:17,50
Sitting behind it, he shoots her a quizzical look. 

THE_VOW_DVS349
00:47:36,00 --> 00:47:41,50
Wincing, SOMEONE glances away. 

THE_VOW_DVS350
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:06,50
He rises. 

THE_VOW_DVS351
00:48:14,00 --> 00:48:19,50
He half-sits on the front of his desk. 

THE_VOW_DVS352
00:48:32,00 --> 00:48:37,50
Averting her gaze, SOMEONE nods disappointedly. 

THE_VOW_DVS353
00:48:55,00 --> 00:48:59,50
They both stand. 

THE_VOW_DVS354
00:48:56,00 --> 00:49:02,50
With a bashful smile, SOMEONE hugs him. 

THE_VOW_DVS355
00:48:59,00 --> 00:49:06,50
He hesitates then wraps his arms around her and wraps his arms around her and rests this chin on her shoulder. 

THE_VOW_DVS356
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:08,50
As they inch apart, SOMEONE cradles the back of his head and they kiss. 

THE_VOW_DVS358
00:49:31,00 --> 00:49:37,50
Blinking back tears, she struggles to remain composed. 

THE_VOW_DVS359
00:49:36,00 --> 00:49:40,50
She bites her lip. 

THE_VOW_DVS361
00:49:40,00 --> 00:49:49,50
Later, at the apartment, she kneels on the dining table, adding photographs to rows of images organized in front of her. Other photos lie in disarray behind her.  

THE_VOW_DVS363
00:49:50,00 --> 00:49:54,50
SOMEONE enters. 

THE_VOW_DVS364
00:49:59,00 --> 00:50:04,50
He kisses her cheek, which unsettles her. 

THE_VOW_DVS365
00:51:43,00 --> 00:51:49,50
As she rests her elbows on the table, he rubs her shoulders. 

THE_VOW_DVS366
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:52,50
He tickles her and she jumps. 

THE_VOW_DVS367
00:52:09,00 --> 00:52:14,50
He ducks into their bedroom. 

THE_VOW_DVS368
00:52:12,00 --> 00:52:17,50
She stares after him. 

THE_VOW_DVS369
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:21,50
Standing just out of view by the doorway, SOMEONE clenches a fist. SOMEONE shifts her sad eyes, then turns away. 

THE_VOW_DVS372
00:52:21,00 --> 00:52:28,50
SOMEONE pours herself coffee then walks to SOMEONE who reads the paper. 

THE_VOW_DVS373
00:52:28,00 --> 00:52:32,50
She sits in front of him. 

THE_VOW_DVS374
00:52:36,00 --> 00:52:42,50
Smiling, he heads off. Outside they walk an alley. 

THE_VOW_DVS376
00:52:41,00 --> 00:52:58,50
Entering the studio, SOMEONE gazes around the spacious, rugged room, cluttered with works in progress and supplies. One bronzy 10-foot sculpture, shaped vaguely like a mermaid bears a pebbled texture. Sketches hang out of a few half-open drawers and a dresser 10 drawers high. 

THE_VOW_DVS377
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:02,50
They explore the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS378
00:53:04,00 --> 00:53:09,50
SOMEONE examines a treelike nymph sculpture. 

THE_VOW_DVS379
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:11,50
Its trunk resembles a woman’s torso. 

THE_VOW_DVS380
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:34,50
SOMEONE gives a sad smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS381
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:41,50
She edges past an industrial pedestal fan. 

THE_VOW_DVS382
00:53:45,00 --> 00:53:51,50
She wrings her hands, eying a feminine sculpture in repose. 

THE_VOW_DVS383
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:03,50
He moves to her unfinished piece. 

THE_VOW_DVS384
00:54:02,00 --> 00:54:06,50
He offers a sculpting knife. 

THE_VOW_DVS385
00:54:10,00 --> 00:54:17,50
Standing at a partially-formed clay sculpture, SOMEONE gives a tense look. 

THE_VOW_DVS386
00:54:23,00 --> 00:54:28,50
He bounces over to the stereo and turns it on. 

THE_VOW_DVS387
00:54:28,00 --> 00:54:33,50
He dances back to SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS388
00:54:46,00 --> 00:54:52,50
As SOMEONE trudges back to the stereo, SOMEONE heaves a ponderous breath. 

THE_VOW_DVS389
00:54:52,00 --> 00:54:57,50
SOMEONE slams down the sound system’s control deck. 

THE_VOW_DVS390
00:54:57,00 --> 00:55:02,50
SOMEONE straightens and peers morosely at him. 

THE_VOW_DVS391
00:55:07,00 --> 00:55:13,50
She drops her admonished gaze. He shrugs. 

THE_VOW_DVS392
00:55:13,00 --> 00:55:19,50
With an exasperated look, he heads to the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS393
00:55:16,00 --> 00:55:21,50
SOMEONE watches him leave the studio, 

THE_VOW_DVS394
00:55:18,00 --> 00:55:25,50
then blinks her troubled eyes. She turns away from the unfinished sculpture. 

THE_VOW_DVS395
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:31,50
Outside, SOMEONE trudges down the alley. His hands curl tensely as they swing at his sides. 

THE_VOW_DVS397
00:55:30,00 --> 00:55:36,50
In the studio, SOMEONE eyes the section of wall covered in drawings and other artwork, 

THE_VOW_DVS398
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:39,50
then faces her towering, treelike sculpture. 

THE_VOW_DVS399
00:55:37,00 --> 00:55:44,50
She eyes its twisted trunk with branches jutting out from the top, like hair on its head. 

THE_VOW_DVS400
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:50,50
Lowering her gaze, she strides for the door and irritably tosses down a piece of clay on her way out. 

THE_VOW_DVS401
00:55:48,00 --> 00:55:54,50
Now, SOMEONE’s Wagoneer rounds a corner by the apartment. 

THE_VOW_DVS402
00:55:56,00 --> 00:56:01,50
At home, SOMEONE writes in a notebook. 

THE_VOW_DVS403
00:55:59,00 --> 00:56:03,50
She tears out a sheet. 

THE_VOW_DVS404
00:56:01,00 --> 00:56:06,50
She folds it hurriedly as SOMEONE walks in. 

THE_VOW_DVS405
00:56:09,00 --> 00:56:16,50
SOMEONE faces the bathroom. Seated at her desk, SOMEONE stands nervously. 

THE_VOW_DVS406
00:56:16,00 --> 00:56:20,50
SOMEONE goes to a bag on the bed. 

THE_VOW_DVS407
00:56:17,00 --> 00:56:22,50
Her father SOMEONE exits the bathroom. 

THE_VOW_DVS408
00:56:42,00 --> 00:56:46,50
SOMEONE continues packing. 

THE_VOW_DVS409
00:57:01,00 --> 00:57:06,50
SOMEONE carries two bags out. 

THE_VOW_DVS410
00:57:03,00 --> 00:57:10,50
SOMEONE puts down his shoulder satchel and regards SOMEONE with a wounded expression. 

THE_VOW_DVS411
00:57:19,00 --> 00:57:26,50
SOMEONE averts his considerate gaze, shakes his head and shifts on his feet. 

THE_VOW_DVS412
00:57:27,00 --> 00:57:33,50
SOMEONE gives a relieved grin and nods. 

THE_VOW_DVS413
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:35,50
Coming forward, she obliges warmly. 

THE_VOW_DVS414
00:57:32,00 --> 00:57:38,50
She steps back, smiles at SOMEONE and leaves. 

THE_VOW_DVS415
00:57:35,00 --> 00:57:40,50
Her husband turns on the spot. 

THE_VOW_DVS416
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:42,50
His jaw clenches, agonizing. 

THE_VOW_DVS417
00:57:41,00 --> 00:57:48,50
Now a penlight shines directly on SOMEONE’s jade green eye. 

THE_VOW_DVS418
00:58:20,00 --> 00:58:24,50
She looks to SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS419
00:58:24,00 --> 00:58:30,50
Her mom looks away worriedly then puts on a smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS420
00:58:28,00 --> 00:58:32,50
Her smile tenses. 

THE_VOW_DVS421
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:37,50
She moves stiffly past SOMEONE’s doctor and leaves the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS422
00:58:34,00 --> 00:58:39,50
Under the doctor’s compassionate smile, 

THE_VOW_DVS423
00:58:37,00 --> 00:58:41,50
the young woman briefly hangs her head. 

THE_VOW_DVS425
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:23,50
SOMEONE takes a deep breath. 

THE_VOW_DVS426
00:59:29,00 --> 00:59:36,50
At the studio, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE as she works a recording session. 

THE_VOW_DVS427
00:59:35,00 --> 00:59:40,50
Teens play on the other side of the glass. 

THE_VOW_DVS428
00:59:55,00 --> 01:00:02,50
SOMEONE wears a suit jacket and narrow tie worn over a crisp white shirt. 

THE_VOW_DVS429
01:00:17,00 --> 01:00:22,50
SOMEONE flips a control board switch. 

THE_VOW_DVS430
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:47,50
Lily’s gaze softens, sympathetically. 

THE_VOW_DVS431
01:00:44,00 --> 01:00:48,50
SOMEONE marches out. 

THE_VOW_DVS433
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:55,50
Outside the Thornton’s mansion, elegant guests attend an engagement party in an immaculately tended back yard. 

THE_VOW_DVS434
01:00:57,00 --> 01:01:02,50
Passing SOMEONE, SOMEONE happens upon SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS435
01:01:11,00 --> 01:01:16,50
Nearby, SOMEONE glowers. 

THE_VOW_DVS436
01:01:58,00 --> 01:02:03,50
As he leaves, SOMEONE smiles at SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS437
01:02:02,00 --> 01:02:07,50
He smirks cryptically. 

THE_VOW_DVS438
01:02:04,00 --> 01:02:10,50
As he steps away, SOMEONE beams after him. 

THE_VOW_DVS439
01:02:07,00 --> 01:02:13,50
Now, SOMEONE strolls the patio, sipping a glass of red wine. 

THE_VOW_DVS440
01:02:11,00 --> 01:02:15,50
He turns. 

THE_VOW_DVS441
01:02:12,00 --> 01:02:17,50
Her styled hair has highlights. 

THE_VOW_DVS442
01:02:16,00 --> 01:02:21,50
He stares at her groomed and lightened tresses. 

THE_VOW_DVS443
01:03:37,00 --> 01:03:44,50
Behind SOMEONE, SOMEONE and a blonde woman converse with SOMEONE Thornton. 

THE_VOW_DVS444
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:09,50
Now, at home, SOMEONE puts on a dark blazer over a muted blue button down, then picks up a tie. 

THE_VOW_DVS445
01:04:07,00 --> 01:04:13,50
Later, he walks a demurely dressed SOMEONE to his Wagoneer. 

THE_VOW_DVS446
01:04:37,00 --> 01:04:43,50
SOMEONE chuckles as he strides briskly around the car. 

THE_VOW_DVS447
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:49,50
Later, under gleaming skyscraper windows, the SUV pulls into a space in a deserted civic parking lot 

THE_VOW_DVS448
01:04:46,00 --> 01:04:51,50
situated before a crosswalk. 

THE_VOW_DVS449
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:54,50
SOMEONE smiles at SOMEONE, then looks around uncertainly. 

THE_VOW_DVS450
01:04:52,00 --> 01:04:57,50
Her husband regards her with a tender gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS451
01:05:17,00 --> 01:05:23,50
SOMEONE responds with a warm appreciative smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS452
01:05:21,00 --> 01:05:30,50
Now at SOMEONE Mnemonic, the front window shows SOMEONE and SOMEONE enjoying a meal and wine at a table for two. 

THE_VOW_DVS453
01:05:37,00 --> 01:05:41,50
He presents chocolates. 

THE_VOW_DVS454
01:05:47,00 --> 01:05:51,50
She smirks inquisitively. 

THE_VOW_DVS455
01:05:53,00 --> 01:05:59,50
She selects a chocolate, then pops it in her mouth. 

THE_VOW_DVS456
01:05:58,00 --> 01:06:02,50
She frowns. 

THE_VOW_DVS457
01:06:04,00 --> 01:06:11,50
As SOMEONE chews the second truffle her eyes light up with a surprised smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS458
01:06:13,00 --> 01:06:18,50
She turns the box of chocolates to face SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS459
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:22,50
SOMEONE eats one, SOMEONE pops another in her mouth. 

THE_VOW_DVS460
01:06:22,00 --> 01:06:27,50
SOMEONE takes a deep breath, then tries another. 

THE_VOW_DVS461
01:06:24,00 --> 01:06:29,50
SOMEONE skeptically chews another truffle. 

THE_VOW_DVS462
01:06:35,00 --> 01:06:41,50
A fleck of truffle filling drops from her mouth onto her hair. 

THE_VOW_DVS463
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:42,50
They both crack up. 

THE_VOW_DVS464
01:06:42,00 --> 01:06:48,50
SOMEONE reaches for the fleck. SOMEONE rocks in her seat. 

THE_VOW_DVS465
01:06:45,00 --> 01:06:50,50
Later, in the night air, 

THE_VOW_DVS466
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:54,50
SOMEONE’s SUV halts on a narrow lane in a quaintly lit public park. 

THE_VOW_DVS467
01:06:51,00 --> 01:06:57,50
He smiles at SOMEONE and directs her gaze out the windshield. 

THE_VOW_DVS468
01:07:02,00 --> 01:07:08,50
SOMEONE unbuttons his shirt and SOMEONE’s smile fades. 

THE_VOW_DVS469
01:07:15,00 --> 01:07:20,50
He removes his shirt. 

THE_VOW_DVS470
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:44,50
He sets a small wetsuit beside her and regards her with a subdued, wily smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS471
01:07:42,00 --> 01:07:46,50
SOMEONE frowns, intrigued. 

THE_VOW_DVS472
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:58,50
SOMEONE unbuckles her safety belt, then writhes in her seat, working her demure dress off over her head. 

THE_VOW_DVS473
01:07:56,00 --> 01:08:00,50
SOMEONE takes a peek. 

THE_VOW_DVS475
01:07:59,00 --> 01:08:04,50
SOMEONE shakes her hair out. 

THE_VOW_DVS476
01:08:02,00 --> 01:08:06,50
SOMEONE turns. 

THE_VOW_DVS477
01:08:06,00 --> 01:08:16,50
He laughs as she dashes out in her bra and panties. Grabbing blankets and towels he hustles after her and does high steps to get out of his jeans. 

THE_VOW_DVS478
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:20,50
SOMEONE runs into the water up to her ankles and bids a hasty retreat. 

THE_VOW_DVS479
01:08:19,00 --> 01:08:26,50
Clad in biker briefs, SOMEONE grabs her around the waist and carries her back in. 

THE_VOW_DVS480
01:08:23,00 --> 01:08:29,50
Joining hands they run further out into the glistening lake. 

THE_VOW_DVS481
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:33,50
SOMEONE plunges in and SOMEONE submerges up to her shoulders. 

THE_VOW_DVS482
01:08:30,00 --> 01:08:37,50
SOMEONE lifts both her feet and her upper body dunks up to her chin. 

THE_VOW_DVS483
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:40,50
Now he helps SOMEONE up and gives her a piggyback ride ashore. 

THE_VOW_DVS484
01:08:38,00 --> 01:08:43,50
Grabbing a towel and blanket, he wraps both around her. 

THE_VOW_DVS485
01:08:47,00 --> 01:08:52,50
SOMEONE hurries back into his car and he follows. 

THE_VOW_DVS486
01:08:53,00 --> 01:09:00,50
SOMEONE wraps a blanket around his shivering shoulders and laughs with SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS487
01:09:04,00 --> 01:09:10,50
SOMEONE considers, then envelops her hands in both his own. 

THE_VOW_DVS488
01:09:08,00 --> 01:09:13,50
He blows on her fingers then kisses them tenderly. 

THE_VOW_DVS490
01:09:12,00 --> 01:09:20,50
Now at the apartment, keys slide along the dining table. At its far end, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sway in an embrace. 

THE_VOW_DVS491
01:09:24,00 --> 01:09:28,50
SOMEONE smiles fondly. 

THE_VOW_DVS492
01:09:27,00 --> 01:09:32,50
In the soft light of the streetlamps outside, he plants two tender kisses on her lips. 

THE_VOW_DVS494
01:09:41,00 --> 01:09:49,50
Leaning close, she brushes SOMEONE’s blanket off his shoulders, while letting her own fall to the floor. 

THE_VOW_DVS495
01:09:46,00 --> 01:09:51,50
Standing in their underwear, they kiss again. 

THE_VOW_DVS496
01:09:55,00 --> 01:10:01,50
SOMEONE smiles up at him sweetly, and his parted lips find hers. 

THE_VOW_DVS497
01:09:59,00 --> 01:10:05,50
The young woman wraps an arm around her husband’s bare shoulder 

THE_VOW_DVS498
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:07,50
and he cradles her head in his hand. 

THE_VOW_DVS499
01:10:04,00 --> 01:10:10,50
SOMEONE’s hand finds his cheek and caresses it softly. 

THE_VOW_DVS500
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:14,50
As they make out, we look on from the far end of the table. 

THE_VOW_DVS501
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:16,50
Our view sinks into the shadows. 

THE_VOW_DVS502
01:10:13,00 --> 01:10:18,50
Now, SOMEONE helps SOMEONE out of his car. 

THE_VOW_DVS503
01:10:21,00 --> 01:10:26,50
SOMEONE heads toward her parents' house. 

THE_VOW_DVS504
01:10:26,00 --> 01:10:30,50
She faces him. 

THE_VOW_DVS506
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:37,50
Her smile gone, SOMEONE shifts her uneasy gaze. SOMEONE shakes his head earnestly. 

THE_VOW_DVS507
01:10:36,00 --> 01:10:41,50
SOMEONE hunches her shoulders and looks away. 

THE_VOW_DVS508
01:10:40,00 --> 01:10:45,50
She meets his gaze with a gentle smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS509
01:10:53,00 --> 01:11:01,50
SOMEONE lingers on the spot, shifting boyishly on his feet as his wife enters her parents’ home. 

THE_VOW_DVS510
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:05,50
As she shuts the door, he turns away and steps around his car. 

THE_VOW_DVS511
01:11:05,00 --> 01:11:12,50
Inside the house, SOMEONE sets down her keys and takes off her shoes. 

THE_VOW_DVS512
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:14,50
In the next room, SOMEONE waits up seated with a book. 

THE_VOW_DVS513
01:11:26,00 --> 01:11:31,50
SOMEONE smiles sadly, her eyes welling up. 

THE_VOW_DVS514
01:11:36,00 --> 01:11:41,50
SOMEONE shakes her head tearfully. 

THE_VOW_DVS515
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:57,50
SOMEONE gives her a hug. 

THE_VOW_DVS516
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:03,50
On a sunny day, SOMEONE walks with his friends. 

THE_VOW_DVS517
01:12:38,00 --> 01:12:42,50
At the Thornton’s. 

THE_VOW_DVS518
01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:52,50
SOMEONE brings SOMEONE a folder. 

THE_VOW_DVS519
01:13:11,00 --> 01:13:15,50
SOMEONE’s mother joins them. 

THE_VOW_DVS520
01:13:17,00 --> 01:13:22,50
SOMEONE hands the file to his daughter. 

THE_VOW_DVS522
01:13:29,00 --> 01:13:35,50
At dusk in the city, two elevated trains pass one another under the Chicago skyline. 

THE_VOW_DVS523
01:13:33,00 --> 01:13:41,50
In the apartment, SOMEONE drops a jacket on a chair and carries a stack of mail to a coffee table. 

THE_VOW_DVS524
01:13:38,00 --> 01:13:44,50
Sitting, he flips through the envelopes. 

THE_VOW_DVS525
01:13:41,00 --> 01:13:46,50
He pauses, then tosses them down. 

THE_VOW_DVS527
01:13:44,00 --> 01:13:50,50
a pink envelope bears a stamp reading Past Due. 

THE_VOW_DVS528
01:13:48,00 --> 01:13:54,50
SOMEONE wearily leans back on the sofa and stares at the ceiling. 

THE_VOW_DVS529
01:13:52,00 --> 01:13:56,50
Now, on a sunny day, 

THE_VOW_DVS530
01:13:53,00 --> 01:14:01,50
yellow rose petals arc through the air as wedding guests shower them on SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS531
01:13:58,00 --> 01:14:03,50
In their tux and gown, 

THE_VOW_DVS532
01:14:00,00 --> 01:14:07,50
the newlyweds joyfully make their way up a narrow aisle between the well-wishers. 

THE_VOW_DVS533
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:10,50
Later, the groom sweeps his bride up in his arms. 

THE_VOW_DVS534
01:14:08,00 --> 01:14:13,50
She laughs delightedly and he kisses her cheek. 

THE_VOW_DVS535
01:14:11,00 --> 01:14:19,50
Later still, SOMEONE steps toward SOMEONE, but then holds back as she joins her sister for a wedding photo. 

THE_VOW_DVS537
01:14:17,00 --> 01:14:24,50
the photographer takes a picture of the sisters, their parents, and SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS538
01:14:22,00 --> 01:14:28,50
The bridal party moves on without SOMEONE, who stands among the guests. 

THE_VOW_DVS539
01:14:26,00 --> 01:14:31,50
He turns on the spot, watching SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS540
01:14:28,00 --> 01:14:33,50
She smiles briefly at him, then turns away. 

THE_VOW_DVS541
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:36,50
SOMEONE moves unhappily through the crowd. 

THE_VOW_DVS542
01:14:33,00 --> 01:14:38,50
Later, with his necktie loosened, 

THE_VOW_DVS543
01:14:35,00 --> 01:14:41,50
he strolls through a lavish outdoor reception 

THE_VOW_DVS544
01:14:38,00 --> 01:14:43,50
and spies SOMEONE dancing with her sister. 

THE_VOW_DVS545
01:14:44,00 --> 01:14:50,50
She fails to notice him and he moves on sullenly. 

THE_VOW_DVS546
01:14:47,00 --> 01:14:56,50
Reaching the edge of the party, he arrives at a crenelated terrace, overlooking the city’s distant gleaming skyline. 

THE_VOW_DVS547
01:14:53,00 --> 01:14:58,50
As he gazes off morosely, 

THE_VOW_DVS548
01:14:55,00 --> 01:15:01,50
SOMEONE approaches with a bottle of fine liquor. 

THE_VOW_DVS549
01:15:06,00 --> 01:15:11,50
He sets two glasses on the parapet. 

THE_VOW_DVS550
01:15:10,00 --> 01:15:14,50
SOMEONE pours the drinks. 

THE_VOW_DVS551
01:15:21,00 --> 01:15:25,50
They clink glasses. 

THE_VOW_DVS552
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:28,50
The two men sip the amber liquor. 

THE_VOW_DVS553
01:15:25,00 --> 01:15:30,50
SOMEONE cocks his head and nods appreciatively. 

THE_VOW_DVS554
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:36,50
SOMEONE puts down his glass, SOMEONE does the same. 

THE_VOW_DVS555
01:15:59,00 --> 01:16:03,50
SOMEONE takes another sip. 

THE_VOW_DVS556
01:16:05,00 --> 01:16:10,50
The young man turns away. 

THE_VOW_DVS557
01:16:34,00 --> 01:16:38,50
SOMEONE stares at him. 

THE_VOW_DVS558
01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:41,50
From the reception, Mrs. Thornton notices the exchange. 

THE_VOW_DVS559
01:16:40,00 --> 01:16:46,50
Moving past him, SOMEONE leaves the terrace. 

THE_VOW_DVS560
01:16:43,00 --> 01:16:49,50
The older man hesitantly takes a drink of his whiskey. 

THE_VOW_DVS561
01:16:46,00 --> 01:16:51,50
Behind him, SOMEONE goes inside. 

THE_VOW_DVS562
01:16:48,00 --> 01:16:55,50
Setting his drink on a coaster, he plunks onto an elegant leather sofa. 

THE_VOW_DVS563
01:16:53,00 --> 01:16:59,50
SOMEONE approaches, finishing off his own drink. 

THE_VOW_DVS564
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:42,50
They stand toe to toe. 

THE_VOW_DVS565
01:17:55,00 --> 01:18:01,50
SOMEONE swallows and vaguely flashes a smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS567
01:18:18,00 --> 01:18:23,50
SOMEONE finds SOMEONE staring at him, stunned. 

THE_VOW_DVS568
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:25,50
She marches off. 

THE_VOW_DVS569
01:18:22,00 --> 01:18:30,50
SOMEONE looks down at SOMEONE, who sprawls on the floor with a bleeding nose, then follows SOMEONE outside. 

THE_VOW_DVS570
01:18:51,00 --> 01:18:55,50
SOMEONE’s eyes glisten. 

THE_VOW_DVS571
01:19:31,00 --> 01:19:36,50
SOMEONE wears a bitter, tearful smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS572
01:19:48,00 --> 01:19:55,50
Blinking back tears, SOMEONE bravely meets her forgiving gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS573
01:19:53,00 --> 01:19:57,50
He grows stoic. 

THE_VOW_DVS574
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:06,50
SOMEONE averts her regretful gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS575
01:20:04,00 --> 01:20:10,50
Bowing his head, SOMEONE shuffles back a few steps, then heads inside. 

THE_VOW_DVS576
01:20:08,00 --> 01:20:12,50
SOMEONE helplessly turns on the spot. 

THE_VOW_DVS577
01:20:13,00 --> 01:20:18,50
Pausing by the door he faces his wife. 

THE_VOW_DVS578
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:34,50
SOMEONE regards her longingly, then turns away and walks back inside. 

THE_VOW_DVS579
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:40,50
SOMEONE stares after her estranged husband, then takes a few deep steadying breaths and shuts her eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS580
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:45,50
Back in the city, SOMEONE lumbers down a sidewalk parallel to elevated train tracks. 

THE_VOW_DVS581
01:20:42,00 --> 01:20:49,50
His suit jacket dangling from one hand, and his tie hanging from the other. 

THE_VOW_DVS582
01:20:46,00 --> 01:20:53,50
His head droops forward and he transfers his coat to his other hand. 

THE_VOW_DVS583
01:20:53,00 --> 01:21:00,50
Now in his recording studio, SOMEONE sits playing an acoustic guitar. 

THE_VOW_DVS584
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:06,50
The view drifts past stacked equipment and microphone stands as we watch the heartbroken young man play. 

THE_VOW_DVS585
01:21:04,00 --> 01:21:10,50
On the other side of the glass, two lamps turn on in the mixing room. 

THE_VOW_DVS586
01:21:08,00 --> 01:21:14,50
SOMEONE walks into view casually and peers at the soundboard. 

THE_VOW_DVS587
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:18,50
In the recording room SOMEONE gently plucks the guitar strings. 

THE_VOW_DVS588
01:21:15,00 --> 01:21:20,50
His lips hold a pensive frown. 

THE_VOW_DVS589
01:21:20,00 --> 01:21:27,50
From the other side of the glass, SOMEONE stares at him, then leaves the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS590
01:21:25,00 --> 01:21:31,50
Unnoticing, SOMEONE’s eyes remain on the instrument in his hands. 

THE_VOW_DVS591
01:21:29,00 --> 01:21:36,50
His wedding ring gleams on his finger as his left hand sets up cords on the fret board. 

THE_VOW_DVS592
01:21:33,00 --> 01:21:39,50
SOMEONE walks up to him with folded arms. 

THE_VOW_DVS593
01:22:54,00 --> 01:23:00,50
SOMEONE gives a tearful sympathetic nod. 

THE_VOW_DVS594
01:23:06,00 --> 01:23:12,50
SOMEONE stares off, tears welling in his deep set eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS595
01:23:13,00 --> 01:23:19,50
He wipes one away, sets his guitar down and faces his friend. 

THE_VOW_DVS596
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:24,50
With a knowing shake of his head, he leaves his sorrowful friend stunned. 

THE_VOW_DVS597
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:32,50
Out in the night, a gliding view of Chicago’s streets and high rises presents a vast expanse of speckled lights. 

THE_VOW_DVS598
01:23:29,00 --> 01:23:34,50
In SOMEONE’s now cleaned out studio, 

THE_VOW_DVS599
01:23:31,00 --> 01:23:36,50
SOMEONE finishes packing a box. 

THE_VOW_DVS600
01:23:34,00 --> 01:23:39,50
A half dozen empty worktables fill the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS601
01:23:37,00 --> 01:23:42,50
SOMEONE closes the box and carries it out. 

THE_VOW_DVS602
01:23:39,00 --> 01:23:45,50
Passing a trio of tall gracefully curved sculptures. 

THE_VOW_DVS603
01:23:43,00 --> 01:23:52,50
Outside, SOMEONE loads the box on top of another in the back of his Wagoneer, then shuts the rear gate. 

THE_VOW_DVS604
01:23:49,00 --> 01:23:53,50
As he goes back inside, 

THE_VOW_DVS605
01:23:51,00 --> 01:23:56,50
a few pots of leggy dying flowers come into view. 

THE_VOW_DVS606
01:23:54,00 --> 01:24:01,50
The plank mounded with SOMEONE’s clay scraps sits discarded beside them. 

THE_VOW_DVS607
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:06,50
Now the bean shaped  cloud gate in Millennium Park reflects an overcast day. 

THE_VOW_DVS608
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:08,50
Inside a high-rise building, 

THE_VOW_DVS609
01:24:05,00 --> 01:24:12,50
a woman at a conference table slides legal documents to SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS610
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:20,50
Next to a notary’s embossed stamp, he locates SOMEONE’s signature on a line labeled Plaintiff. 

THE_VOW_DVS611
01:24:17,00 --> 01:24:24,50
Above a phrase reads, Joint Petition for Simplified Dissolution of Marriage. 

THE_VOW_DVS612
01:24:22,00 --> 01:24:29,50
SOMEONE glances at the lawyer and signs his name on a line marked Defendant. 

THE_VOW_DVS613
01:24:26,00 --> 01:24:32,50
He twists the pen shut, drops it and leaves the table. 

THE_VOW_DVS614
01:24:30,00 --> 01:24:35,50
Now shirtless on a cloudy day, 

THE_VOW_DVS615
01:24:32,00 --> 01:24:38,50
the broad chested young man takes the garbage out 

THE_VOW_DVS616
01:24:35,00 --> 01:24:40,50
and finds the stray cat perched on the trash bin. 

THE_VOW_DVS617
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:44,50
Munching a slice of pizza, he offers some to the cat. 

THE_VOW_DVS618
01:24:45,00 --> 01:24:51,50
The feline shows no interest in the food, but lets SOMEONE pick him up. 

THE_VOW_DVS619
01:24:50,00 --> 01:24:57,50
The cat’s paws rest on SOMEONE’s shoulder, as he carries the animal inside. 

THE_VOW_DVS620
01:24:56,00 --> 01:25:02,50
Now SOMEONE spots SOMEONE at a market and quickly turns tail. 

THE_VOW_DVS621
01:25:00,00 --> 01:25:05,50
SOMEONE grins at the apprehensive woman. 

THE_VOW_DVS622
01:25:29,00 --> 01:25:34,50
SOMEONE's words sink in hard. 

THE_VOW_DVS623
01:25:46,00 --> 01:25:50,50
SOMEONE approaches. 

THE_VOW_DVS624
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:57,50
She sees SOMEONE hurrying out the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS625
01:25:54,00 --> 01:26:00,50
With a reluctant look, she faces her sister and meets her gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS626
01:25:58,00 --> 01:26:02,50
SOMEONE shrugs her hands. 

THE_VOW_DVS627
01:26:04,00 --> 01:26:08,50
SOMEONE nods. 

THE_VOW_DVS628
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:16,50
SOMEONE rushes away. 

THE_VOW_DVS629
01:26:14,00 --> 01:26:20,50
Now SOMEONE finds her mother gardening in front of the house. 

THE_VOW_DVS630
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:28,50
SOMEONE shoves down her bicycle. 

THE_VOW_DVS631
01:26:28,00 --> 01:26:32,50
Her mother bows her head. 

THE_VOW_DVS632
01:27:14,00 --> 01:27:20,50
Shaking her head, her mother lowers her tearful eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS633
01:27:37,00 --> 01:27:41,50
Smiling, she wipes away tears. 

THE_VOW_DVS634
01:28:27,00 --> 01:28:31,50
SOMEONE’s eyes brim with tears. 

THE_VOW_DVS635
01:28:32,00 --> 01:28:37,50
SOMEONE slouches and shakes her head to herself. 

THE_VOW_DVS636
01:28:35,00 --> 01:28:39,50
She shrugs. 

THE_VOW_DVS637
01:28:46,00 --> 01:28:50,50
Glaring, she walks away. 

THE_VOW_DVS638
01:28:48,00 --> 01:28:54,50
Her mother remains kneeling before the autumn flowerbed. 

THE_VOW_DVS639
01:28:52,00 --> 01:28:58,50
Now in the city, a water taxi glides under a bridge. 

THE_VOW_DVS640
01:28:56,00 --> 01:29:02,50
SOMEONE and a young woman follow the sidewalk in front of his apartment building. 

THE_VOW_DVS641
01:29:05,00 --> 01:29:11,50
As they stroll into the alley, SOMEONE’s grin fades. 

THE_VOW_DVS642
01:29:09,00 --> 01:29:17,50
His ex-wife sits on a stoop with her head rested on her hands. She awkwardly gets to her feet. 

THE_VOW_DVS643
01:29:19,00 --> 01:29:24,50
Closing her eyes for a moment, SOMEONE winces. 

THE_VOW_DVS644
01:29:28,00 --> 01:29:35,50
SOMEONE watches his female friend leave, then faces SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS645
01:29:33,00 --> 01:29:37,50
He steps closer. 

THE_VOW_DVS646
01:29:36,00 --> 01:29:40,50
SOMEONE glances aside. 

THE_VOW_DVS647
01:29:55,00 --> 01:30:00,50
She sits back down on the stoop. 

THE_VOW_DVS648
01:30:01,00 --> 01:30:06,50
SOMEONE takes a seat beside her. 

THE_VOW_DVS649
01:30:28,00 --> 01:30:34,50
SOMEONE studies him, her expression growing tender. 

THE_VOW_DVS650
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:38,50
As SOMEONE regards her, she sucks in a breath and gazes off thoughtfully. 

THE_VOW_DVS651
01:30:36,00 --> 01:30:42,50
SOMEONE shakes her head and drops her face in her hands. 

THE_VOW_DVS652
01:30:40,00 --> 01:30:44,50
Folding them she stares off. 

THE_VOW_DVS653
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:53,50
Meeting SOMEONE’s gaze, she shrugs. 

THE_VOW_DVS654
01:30:53,00 --> 01:30:58,50
He returns a gentle look and she considers him. 

THE_VOW_DVS655
01:30:56,00 --> 01:31:00,50
Now at North Western Law, 

THE_VOW_DVS656
01:30:58,00 --> 01:31:03,50
SOMEONE sits in a lecture classroom with her notebook open. 

THE_VOW_DVS657
01:31:09,00 --> 01:31:16,50
As the other students around her diligently take notes and type on laptops, 

THE_VOW_DVS658
01:31:14,00 --> 01:31:18,50
SOMEONE draws in her notebook, 

THE_VOW_DVS659
01:31:16,00 --> 01:31:23,50
making sketches that resemble the treelike sculptures in her former studio. 

THE_VOW_DVS660
01:31:20,00 --> 01:31:28,50
Later, at a water taxi stop on the river, she walks with SOMEONE up a flight of stairs. 

THE_VOW_DVS661
01:32:31,00 --> 01:32:36,50
SOMEONE glances away. 

THE_VOW_DVS662
01:32:41,00 --> 01:32:46,50
She gazes at him with an apologetic look. 

THE_VOW_DVS663
01:32:44,00 --> 01:32:48,50
He forces a smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS664
01:32:46,00 --> 01:32:53,50
As they head up to the street, she takes his arm in a friendly gesture. 

THE_VOW_DVS665
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:58,50
Now SOMEONE sits on a bench on the law school’s quad and stares into the distance. 

THE_VOW_DVS666
01:32:55,00 --> 01:33:00,50
Her father approaches. 

THE_VOW_DVS667
01:33:14,00 --> 01:33:18,50
He takes a seat beside her. 

THE_VOW_DVS668
01:33:26,00 --> 01:33:31,50
SOMEONE’s smile fades. 

THE_VOW_DVS669
01:33:35,00 --> 01:33:39,50
He stands. 

THE_VOW_DVS670
01:33:55,00 --> 01:33:59,50
Her gaze flickers over him. 

THE_VOW_DVS671
01:33:59,00 --> 01:34:04,50
He eyes her lovingly and gives a faint smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS673
01:34:03,00 --> 01:34:09,50
Seen in slow motion, SOMEONE hugs him, her chin pressing firmly to his shoulder. 

THE_VOW_DVS674
01:34:10,00 --> 01:34:19,50
Now in the alley by the flowerpot garden, fall turns to winter. Snow veils SOMEONE’s clay scrap pile. 

THE_VOW_DVS675
01:34:24,00 --> 01:34:29,50
Now Page paints animals on a nursery wall. 

THE_VOW_DVS676
01:34:29,00 --> 01:34:34,50
Her pregnant sister smiles, watching. 

THE_VOW_DVS677
01:34:34,00 --> 01:34:42,50
The sisters admire the mural which shows a giraffe, an elephant, and a lion balancing atop round trees. 

THE_VOW_DVS678
01:34:44,00 --> 01:34:50,50
SOMEONE listens as a band records in his studio. 

THE_VOW_DVS679
01:34:49,00 --> 01:34:55,50
In a new apartment, SOMEONE ladles her parents’ soup. 

THE_VOW_DVS680
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:01,50
The cat lies on SOMEONE’s stomach. 

THE_VOW_DVS681
01:35:06,00 --> 01:35:10,50
SOMEONE sculpts in her apartment. 

THE_VOW_DVS682
01:35:17,00 --> 01:35:27,50
Rifling through an unpacked box, SOMEONE finds the SOMEONE Mnemonic menu with her vows written on it. She reads. 

THE_VOW_DVS683
01:35:47,00 --> 01:35:56,50
A factory style window shows a nighttime view of a light snowfall and a car traveling the warmly lit street. 

THE_VOW_DVS684
01:35:53,00 --> 01:35:58,50
SOMEONE looks away thoughtfully. 

THE_VOW_DVS685
01:35:55,00 --> 01:36:05,50
Now SOMEONE holds his coat, closed around his neck as he walks past a row of snow dusted Christmas trees for sale. 

THE_VOW_DVS686
01:36:02,00 --> 01:36:08,50
Striding down a sidewalk with hunched shoulders, 

THE_VOW_DVS687
01:36:05,00 --> 01:36:10,50
he blows on his cupped hands. 

THE_VOW_DVS688
01:36:07,00 --> 01:36:12,50
As he reaches the entrance to SOMEONE Mnemonic, 

THE_VOW_DVS689
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:15,50
he finds a note written on a menu taped to the glass. 

THE_VOW_DVS690
01:36:12,00 --> 01:36:17,50
It reads, snow day. 

THE_VOW_DVS691
01:36:14,00 --> 01:36:19,50
He gives a disappointed look. 

THE_VOW_DVS692
01:36:17,00 --> 01:36:23,50
Meanwhile SOMEONE heads toward the SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS693
01:36:22,00 --> 01:36:29,50
Turning from the entrance SOMEONE starts to walk off, but spots SOMEONE approaching. 

THE_VOW_DVS694
01:36:27,00 --> 01:36:33,50
She stops and puts her hands in her coat pockets. 

THE_VOW_DVS695
01:36:34,00 --> 01:36:39,50
Grinning, she steps closer. 

THE_VOW_DVS696
01:36:38,00 --> 01:36:44,50
He gazes tenderly at her, then glances at the SOMEONE. 

THE_VOW_DVS697
01:37:14,00 --> 01:37:19,50
He stares at her radiant smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS698
01:37:33,00 --> 01:37:37,50
He smiles. 

THE_VOW_DVS699
01:37:36,00 --> 01:37:41,50
His eyes shine with tears. 

THE_VOW_DVS700
01:37:40,00 --> 01:37:46,50
She nods then lifts her eyes to the falling snow. 

THE_VOW_DVS701
01:37:43,00 --> 01:37:47,50
He follows her gaze skyward. 

THE_VOW_DVS702
01:38:27,00 --> 01:38:33,50
The corners of SOMEONE’s mouth tug into a smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS703
01:38:39,00 --> 01:38:43,50
She shakes her head. 

THE_VOW_DVS704
01:38:40,00 --> 01:38:46,50
Stifling a grin, he gives a satisfied nod. 

THE_VOW_DVS705
01:38:57,00 --> 01:39:02,50
They head down the sidewalk. 

THE_VOW_DVS706
01:39:10,00 --> 01:39:17,50
She takes his arm as they head down the snowy street in the opposite direction. 

THE_VOW_DVS707
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:19,50
An L train glides overhead. 

THE_VOW_DVS708
01:39:22,00 --> 01:39:28,50
Our view widens to show the glittering city scape. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS19
00:02:42,00 --> 00:02:47,50
Opening it, she finds earrings inside. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS20
00:02:46,00 --> 00:02:52,50
Stifling a disappointed look, she holds them up and forces a grin. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS22
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:29,50
His five friends all turn and stare at him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS24
00:05:02,00 --> 00:05:10,50
Cooking in her kitchen, SOMEONE gets a text: Mind if I hang with the guys? I'll pick up some pizza on the way home. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS26
00:05:26,00 --> 00:05:31,50
He leans in too close. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS28
00:05:57,00 --> 00:06:02,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE trade places. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS29
00:06:36,00 --> 00:06:41,50
The woman averts her gloomy gaze. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS30
00:07:11,00 --> 00:07:16,50
With a smile, he turns away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS31
00:07:15,00 --> 00:07:19,50
SOMEONE counts down on his fingers. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS32
00:07:17,00 --> 00:07:23,50
He cocks his head at SOMEONE, then turns back to the pretty woman. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS34
00:09:37,00 --> 00:09:42,50
Everyone but SOMEONE raises their beer. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS37
00:10:19,00 --> 00:10:23,50
At the Ritz-Carlton. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS38
00:10:39,00 --> 00:10:45,50
She watches from her treadmill in a kitchen. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS39
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:21,50
A young man with tattoos across his pecs, shoulders, and arms sleeps in bed. The woman from the coffee shop stands over him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS40
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:33,50
Stretching, he opens his eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS42
00:11:53,00 --> 00:11:59,50
She gives him another quick kiss, then heads into the bathroom. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS43
00:11:59,00 --> 00:12:04,50
He dresses hastily. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS45
00:12:27,00 --> 00:12:31,50
She reemerges. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS46
00:12:29,00 --> 00:12:35,50
She finds a note on the bed reading, Michelle, it was fun. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS50
00:12:54,00 --> 00:12:59,50
People fight over copies. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS53
00:13:16,00 --> 00:13:28,50
SOMEONE reads as she heads down a sidewalk. The successful business woman crosses paths with her and rolls her eyes. Now words type out: The Mama's Boy vs. The Single Mom 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS54
00:13:26,00 --> 00:13:33,50
In a SOMEONE and Noble, SOMEONE spots the single mother two paces ahead of him in line. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS55
00:13:30,00 --> 00:13:36,50
She hides her SOMEONE Harvey book under a kitten calendar. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS56
00:13:57,00 --> 00:14:02,50
He dawns glasses from a display and grins. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS57
00:14:40,00 --> 00:14:48,50
SOMEONE steps up to the register. SOMEONE gives the next guy a pleading look, and he lets him cut ahead. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS58
00:15:03,00 --> 00:15:09,50
Noting his disappointed look, SOMEONE turns away and collects her purchase. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS59
00:15:09,00 --> 00:15:15,50
She faces him with a surprised expression, then allows a hopeful smile. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS60
00:15:14,00 --> 00:15:20,50
At an open house: The Non-Committer vs. The Girl Who Wants The Ring 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS61
00:15:42,00 --> 00:15:47,50
A pregnant couple enters. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS62
00:15:48,00 --> 00:15:56,50
As the well-dressed husband helps his wife down a few steps, SOMEONE's friend's jaw drops. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS63
00:16:41,00 --> 00:16:46,50
The guys play horse. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS64
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:54,50
Steadying himself on SOMEONE, SOMEONE lifts his leg and shoots the ball with one hand. It bounces off the rim. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS65
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:29,50
SOMEONE sneers at displayed toys and a bong. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS66
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:36,50
She knocks over a giant toy robot. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS69
00:18:04,00 --> 00:18:08,50
SOMEONE arrives. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS70
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:29,50
Words appear: The Dreamer vs. The Woman Who Is Her Own Man 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS72
00:18:32,00 --> 00:18:37,50
He and two friends eyed the successful woman. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS73
00:18:51,00 --> 00:18:56,50
At the table, she sits with SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS75
00:21:59,00 --> 00:22:03,50
She shows the book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS77
00:23:17,00 --> 00:23:23,50
Now SOMEONE returns home to find bare walls and empty shelves. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS78
00:23:26,00 --> 00:23:30,50
He drops his pizza box. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS79
00:24:21,00 --> 00:24:26,50
A brown lumpy sofa with duct taped cushions 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS80
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:52,50
She shows some catalogs. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS81
00:25:23,00 --> 00:25:27,50
He kisses her cheek. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS83
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:32,50
He turns on the TV. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS84
00:25:30,00 --> 00:25:35,50
With SOMEONE and a friend. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS85
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:40,50
SOMEONE approaches. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS86
00:25:56,00 --> 00:26:01,50
The Player vs. The 90-Day Rule Girl 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS87
00:26:23,00 --> 00:26:27,50
SOMEONE gives a downward twitch of her lip. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS89
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:08,50
SOMEONE stands nearby. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS91
00:28:52,00 --> 00:29:00,50
As her friend chuckles, SOMEONE's face relaxes with a conceding smile. She shakes his hand. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS92
00:29:05,00 --> 00:29:10,50
At the restaurant the chef approaches SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS93
00:29:11,00 --> 00:29:17,50
Outside, SOMEONE approaches her car and hands over her valet ticket. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS96
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:31,50
SOMEONE watches her slide her jacket off revealing her silky smooth bare shoulders. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS97
00:29:28,00 --> 00:29:33,50
With a little smile, she gets in behind the wheel. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS98
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:37,50
Keeping his eyes on her, SOMEONE opens the car's gull-wing door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS99
00:29:34,00 --> 00:29:40,50
As SOMEONE drives away, he speeds off after her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS100
00:29:41,00 --> 00:29:52,50
Now that Mercedes races around a corner. Stopped at a red light, SOMEONE watches it in her rear view mirror as it slows and pulls up to her right side. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS101
00:29:53,00 --> 00:29:57,50
She lowers her passenger side window. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS102
00:29:55,00 --> 00:30:00,50
SOMEONE searches the many buttons on the console. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS103
00:30:01,00 --> 00:30:07,50
He self-consciously lifts a finger signaling her to wait. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS104
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:19,50
His gull-wing door slowly rises. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS106
00:31:03,00 --> 00:31:07,50
She tosses it across the room. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS107
00:31:07,00 --> 00:31:16,50
Sucking in her cheeks, she gazes out at the city through floor-to-ceiling windows. Her eyes slowly shift back toward it. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS108
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:19,50
Now SOMEONE highlights a question in SOMEONE's book, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS109
00:31:16,00 --> 00:31:21,50
What are your short-term goals? 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS111
00:31:48,00 --> 00:31:58,50
The guys play a half court three-on-three game. SOMEONE tries for a three-pointer, but it bounces off the rim and SOMEONE gets the rebound. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS112
00:33:07,00 --> 00:33:14,50
SOMEONE rubs the ball against his crotch, then tosses it to SOMEONEt. He catches it in his shirt. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS113
00:33:16,00 --> 00:33:22,50
Later, SOMEONE arrives at home to find it completely redecorated. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS114
00:33:19,00 --> 00:33:25,50
Exiting a room, a well-dressed man almost collides with him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS115
00:33:30,00 --> 00:33:34,50
He spots two guys moving a chair. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS116
00:33:58,00 --> 00:34:03,50
He grabs his chair as movers carry it off. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS118
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:17,50
The designer turns away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS119
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:25,50
Now at SOMEONE's apartment, her friend grins as SOMEONE enters the living room wearing a tight black dress. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS120
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:16,50
SOMEONE returns to the living room in a form-fitting sheath dress, with a longer skirt. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS121
00:35:13,00 --> 00:35:18,50
She examines her reflection in a full-length mirror. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS122
00:35:55,00 --> 00:36:01,50
SOMEONE gives Sonia a disappointed look, then turns away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS124
00:36:01,00 --> 00:36:09,50
At the Ritz-Carlton Residences, two suited men open the front double doors for SOMEONE as she strides out, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS125
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:11,50
dressed in the form-fitting cocktail dress. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS127
00:36:13,00 --> 00:36:20,50
He holds a Town Car's door open and she climbs in. He gratefully blows kisses skyward. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS128
00:36:17,00 --> 00:36:22,50
Sitting beside her, he gives her a rose. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS129
00:36:32,00 --> 00:36:38,50
Dressed in a chauffeur's uniform, SOMEONE turns forward and drives off. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS130
00:36:35,00 --> 00:36:42,50
Now as SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk toward his car, he hits the locks remote. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS131
00:36:41,00 --> 00:36:45,50
He heads to the driver's side. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS133
00:36:56,00 --> 00:37:02,50
He speeds off. SOMEONE stares after him, her jaw hanging. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS134
00:37:01,00 --> 00:37:06,50
The car backs up, returning to the curb in front of her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS135
00:37:04,00 --> 00:37:08,50
SOMEONE takes a steadying breath. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS136
00:37:07,00 --> 00:37:11,50
She rolls her eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS137
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:13,50
SOMEONE climbs out of the car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS138
00:37:12,00 --> 00:37:15,50
He opens her door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS140
00:37:19,00 --> 00:37:24,50
Now his red Taurus sedan drives off. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS142
00:37:32,00 --> 00:37:36,50
SOMEONE nods. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS143
00:37:35,00 --> 00:37:41,50
She gives SOMEONE a frustrated look. He holds up a placating hand. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS145
00:37:55,00 --> 00:37:59,50
At dinner with SOMEONE and SOMEONE 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS146
00:38:10,00 --> 00:38:14,50
With SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS147
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:16,50
She sips wine. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS148
00:39:03,00 --> 00:39:08,50
Lifting her brow, she drinks innocently. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS149
00:39:18,00 --> 00:39:22,50
She offers a smile. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS150
00:39:35,00 --> 00:39:40,50
He lifts his wine glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS151
00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:45,50
Now lying back on the bed beside SOMEONE, SOMEONE exhales smoke. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS152
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:47,50
SOMEONE releases a stream of it as well. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS153
00:40:24,00 --> 00:40:30,50
Furrowing his brow, he gives her a baffled look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS154
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:37,50
Later in the car with SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS155
00:40:57,00 --> 00:41:01,50
She looks away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS156
00:41:33,00 --> 00:41:37,50
He hands her the case. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS157
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:39,50
She eyes his photo. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS158
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:48,50
He turns away thoughtfully. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS159
00:41:47,00 --> 00:41:51,50
He hits a button on his steering wheel. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS160
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:57,50
He closes his eyes, then gazes at SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS162
00:42:16,00 --> 00:42:22,50
As SOMEONE gazes off, his eyes forlorn, SOMEONE listens intently. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS163
00:42:39,00 --> 00:42:45,50
He shifts his gaze to the stereo's display panel. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS164
00:42:42,00 --> 00:42:46,50
SOMEONE scrutinizes him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS165
00:42:45,00 --> 00:42:49,50
He locks eyes with her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS166
00:42:48,00 --> 00:42:54,50
She glances away, then shoots him a contemplative look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS167
00:42:51,00 --> 00:42:58,50
Now at SOMEONE's apartment, SOMEONE kisses her neck as she takes off his belt. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS168
00:42:57,00 --> 00:43:02,50
He picks her up with her knees straddling his waist. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS169
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:08,50
He sets her down. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS170
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:19,50
She kisses him passionately. Now at SOMEONE's front door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS171
00:43:18,00 --> 00:43:23,50
SOMEONE tentatively leans in for a kiss. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS172
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:29,50
She meets his lips with hers. As they separate, SOMEONE grins. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS173
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:52,50
The door opens. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS174
00:44:02,00 --> 00:44:07,50
Watching him, SOMEONE grins. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS175
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:15,50
Duke slams the door. Outside SOMEONE's 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS176
00:44:16,00 --> 00:44:23,50
Smiling, she gazes at him hungrily, then gives him a passionate kiss. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS177
00:44:50,00 --> 00:44:55,50
With a cool look, she opens the door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS178
00:44:53,00 --> 00:44:58,50
She flashes a smile, then closes it. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS179
00:44:55,00 --> 00:44:59,50
SOMEONE turns away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS180
00:45:00,00 --> 00:45:08,50
Inside, SOMEONE places a red X beside another on a monthly calendar. Morning. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS181
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:12,50
Our view drifts toward downtown Los Angeles where pale, pink light lines the horizon. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS182
00:45:10,00 --> 00:45:14,50
In her apartment, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS183
00:45:11,00 --> 00:45:17,50
SOMEONE stretches her arm across the bed as she awakes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS184
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:19,50
Finding the spot beside her vacant, she sits up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS185
00:45:17,00 --> 00:45:22,50
Shirtless, SOMEONE enters the room. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS186
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:28,50
He offers a glass of orange juice. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS187
00:45:35,00 --> 00:45:39,50
He takes her glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS188
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:47,50
She forks up a bite. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS189
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:03,50
He hands her the glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS190
00:46:02,00 --> 00:46:08,50
Averting her gaze, she takes a sip, then returns the drink. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS191
00:46:07,00 --> 00:46:12,50
He spots a framed photo with SOMEONE in it. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS192
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:25,50
He crawls onto the bed. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS193
00:46:24,00 --> 00:46:29,50
He kisses her, then lowers himself on top of her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS194
00:46:27,00 --> 00:46:31,50
Now, at his loft apartment, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS195
00:46:28,00 --> 00:46:34,50
SOMEONE pads into the kitchen wearing only pajama pants. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS197
00:47:22,00 --> 00:47:26,50
SOMEONE receives a text message. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS198
00:47:25,00 --> 00:47:29,50
She reads. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS200
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:49,50
SOMEONE arrives 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS201
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:07,50
with SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS202
00:49:16,00 --> 00:49:20,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS203
00:49:31,00 --> 00:49:36,50
Now SOMEONE joins his friends at the bar. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS207
00:51:54,00 --> 00:51:58,50
She settles into bed. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS208
00:51:57,00 --> 00:52:02,50
He does the same, but they both lie awake. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS209
00:52:08,00 --> 00:52:14,50
SOMEONE plays a video game with Duke. Later, he shows a photo. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS210
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:59,50
Turning, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE in his underwear. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS211
00:53:12,00 --> 00:53:17,50
Ron Artest approaches. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS214
00:53:49,00 --> 00:53:59,50
He turns and slaps each of his reluctant friends' hands. Behind him, SOMEONE Leslie and three more NBA players approach. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS215
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:01,50
He turns. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS216
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:06,50
SOMEONE turns back to his friends, leaning his hands on his knees. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS217
00:54:17,00 --> 00:54:26,50
SOMEONE tries to grab the ball out of Ron's hands. He hangs on it, pulling with his full weight, then falls to the floor. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS218
00:54:50,00 --> 00:54:54,50
He points to SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS219
00:54:54,00 --> 00:55:00,50
Now at a luncheon at a JW Marriott banquet room. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS222
00:55:11,00 --> 00:55:22,50
As she goes to the podium, SOMEONE brings out a tray of salads. His jaw drops. As he turns to leave, he knocks over another server. SOMEONE sees him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS223
00:55:21,00 --> 00:55:26,50
SOMEONE enters his mother's house. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS224
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:46,50
Wide-eyed, SOMEONE looks around. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS225
00:55:48,00 --> 00:55:56,50
SOMEONE's mom glares over her wine glass, taking a long sip. SOMEONE notices a picture of SOMEONE as a boy. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS226
00:56:31,00 --> 00:56:35,50
Frowning, his mom leaves. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS227
00:56:36,00 --> 00:56:40,50
At a wall of photos, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS228
00:56:53,00 --> 00:56:59,50
SOMEONE peeks into a room decorated with trophies and posters. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS230
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:43,50
SOMEONE shifts her wide-eyed gaze. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS231
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:59,50
Now SOMEONE reads a chapter titled, Mama's Boys. Snippets read, Excessively attached to their mother's. He doesn't want to grow up. They just can't compete. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS232
00:58:04,00 --> 00:58:08,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in his car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS233
00:58:21,00 --> 00:58:25,50
Now she leads the way into her apartment. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS235
00:59:13,00 --> 00:59:20,50
As SOMEONE steps down the hall, SOMEONE flips through her collection of record albums. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS236
00:59:23,00 --> 00:59:30,50
He flips a record between his hands, sets it on the player, and gently drops the needle. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS237
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:36,50
Stepping back, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS238
00:59:34,00 --> 00:59:40,50
SOMEONE takes breath spray from his pocket and squirts some into his mouth. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS239
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:43,50
He gets out two condoms and looks at their different wrappings, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS240
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:45,50
stuffing a gold one back in his pocket, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS242
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:50,50
unbuttons his shirt and peels off his jacket. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS243
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:52,50
SOMEONE returns with a tray. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS244
01:00:00,00 --> 01:00:10,50
Now at the loft, SOMEONE rubs his fingers in between his toes, smells them, then wipes them on the arm of his leather chair. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS246
01:01:03,00 --> 01:01:07,50
He takes two beers. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS247
01:01:16,00 --> 01:01:20,50
With SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS248
01:01:47,00 --> 01:01:51,50
They see SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS249
01:01:53,00 --> 01:01:58,50
As he strides off, Sonia laughs. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS250
01:02:02,00 --> 01:02:06,50
With SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS251
01:03:30,00 --> 01:03:34,50
The guys head out of the gym. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS252
01:04:19,00 --> 01:04:23,50
She takes SOMEONE's wine glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS254
01:04:37,00 --> 01:04:42,50
Inside, the guys toast with shots. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS259
01:08:38,00 --> 01:08:43,50
She playfully waves a bite in front of his mouth. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS260
01:08:50,00 --> 01:08:54,50
He finds SOMEONE Harvey's book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS262
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:17,50
SOMEONE makes a call. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS263
01:10:04,00 --> 01:10:08,50
SOMEONE enters. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS264
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:33,50
SOMEONE starts toward him, and SOMEONE quickly leaves. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS265
01:12:01,00 --> 01:12:06,50
SOMEONE's eyes dart searchingly. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS266
01:12:07,00 --> 01:12:12,50
SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE on a modern sofa. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS268
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:22,50
SOMEONE comes down the stairs. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS269
01:13:31,00 --> 01:13:35,50
SOMEONE sips some milk. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS270
01:13:58,00 --> 01:14:03,50
SOMEONE spits out his water. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS271
01:14:54,00 --> 01:14:59,50
Now SOMEONE opens the loft door for SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS272
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:03,50
With a little pout, she enters. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS273
01:15:01,00 --> 01:15:08,50
Gazing around the expansive modern space, she mouths, Whoa. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS274
01:15:15,00 --> 01:15:20,50
Wide-eyed, SOMEONE watches him pour a glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS275
01:15:33,00 --> 01:15:38,50
He steps close, offering a glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS276
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:40,50
SOMEONE side-steps away from him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS277
01:15:38,00 --> 01:15:42,50
SOMEONE stifles a smile. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS278
01:15:43,00 --> 01:15:50,50
He moves closer. She toasts bluntly, then takes another side-step. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS279
01:15:47,00 --> 01:15:53,50
Finishing her sip of wine, SOMEONE closes her eyes ecstatically. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS281
01:16:05,00 --> 01:16:13,50
Before an impressive view of the city, an elegantly set table for two sits surrounded by candlelight. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS282
01:16:12,00 --> 01:16:18,50
Keeping his gaze on here, SOMEONE gives a soft nod. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS283
01:16:16,00 --> 01:16:21,50
The couple approaches the table and a nearby service cart. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS284
01:16:19,00 --> 01:16:24,50
As SOMEONE wraps his arms around SOMEONE from behind, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS285
01:16:21,00 --> 01:16:26,50
SOMEONE arrives bearing a covered tray. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS286
01:16:28,00 --> 01:16:32,50
He fumbles the trays lid. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS287
01:16:44,00 --> 01:16:51,50
As SOMEONE leaves the couple, he shoves one of the hors d'oeuvres into his mouth. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS289
01:17:06,00 --> 01:17:12,50
As they hold each other close, they gaze out at the city rooftops. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS290
01:17:12,00 --> 01:17:18,50
Tucking her hair behind her ear, she gives him a little shrug. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS291
01:17:18,00 --> 01:17:22,50
She closes her eyes for a moment, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS292
01:17:20,00 --> 01:17:24,50
then faces SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS295
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:43,50
SOMEONE tosses away the rest of her hors d'oeuvre 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS296
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:45,50
and wraps her arms around SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS297
01:17:43,00 --> 01:17:49,50
Now SOMEONE sits alone in his parked car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS298
01:17:58,00 --> 01:18:05,50
Sitting on the closed toilet, SOMEONE consults SOMEONE Harvey's book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS300
01:18:34,00 --> 01:18:39,50
Now SOMEONE answers her door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS302
01:18:55,00 --> 01:19:04,50
Later, spotlights at L.A. Live shine into the sky as SOMEONE and SOMEONE stroll a bustling walkway. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS303
01:19:53,00 --> 01:19:58,50
The couple looks expectantly at SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS304
01:19:58,00 --> 01:20:02,50
SOMEONE eyes her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS305
01:20:16,00 --> 01:20:20,50
SOMEONE glances at Xavier. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS306
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:24,50
He meets her surprised gaze. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS307
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:33,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE make out in his car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS309
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:38,50
Just as her granny panties come into view, she jumps back. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS310
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:41,50
She covers herself up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS311
01:20:46,00 --> 01:20:49,50
She kisses him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS312
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:54,50
She hurries out of the car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS314
01:21:29,00 --> 01:21:33,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE's phone. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS315
01:21:39,00 --> 01:21:44,50
SOMEONE pulls out of the driveway. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS318
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:54,50
SOMEONE hits his car's remote, then leaves SOMEONE's side. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS319
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:56,50
He opens her door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS322
01:22:11,00 --> 01:22:16,50
SOMEONE stands at a street. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS323
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:19,50
SOMEONE helps Duke ride a bike. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS325
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:27,50
Later, SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie on the floor beside her bed, surrounded by rose petals. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS326
01:22:24,00 --> 01:22:30,50
He kisses her, then runs his tongue along her knee. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS327
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:33,50
Reaching for a dish with raspberries and chocolate cake, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS328
01:22:30,00 --> 01:22:35,50
he grabs some of the dessert and feeds it to her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS329
01:22:32,00 --> 01:22:39,50
Now SOMEONE enters his living room, framed by one of SOMEONE's bare, bent legs. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS330
01:22:36,00 --> 01:22:41,50
He pauses and shakes his head. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS331
01:22:47,00 --> 01:22:51,50
He sits beside her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS332
01:22:49,00 --> 01:22:53,50
They kiss. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS333
01:23:11,00 --> 01:23:16,50
She nuzzles his nose with hers. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS334
01:23:22,00 --> 01:23:26,50
SOMEONE opens his eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS335
01:23:47,00 --> 01:23:52,50
SOMEONE eyes him skeptically. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS336
01:23:55,00 --> 01:24:00,50
With a disappointed look, she gets up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS337
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:09,50
Now SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE outside the Ritz. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS338
01:24:08,00 --> 01:24:12,50
A battered sedan pulls up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS339
01:24:12,00 --> 01:24:20,50
SOMEONE eyes the beat up silver car, with its missing front bumper, and exposed radiator as it peels out. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS340
01:24:17,00 --> 01:24:27,50
A woman waiting in the valet area shoots SOMEONE a dubious look. The successful business woman meets her gaze with a challenging expression. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS341
01:24:25,00 --> 01:24:35,50
A sleek black Porsche pulls into the valet area. SOMEONE's lips part in a lustful look as her eyes trail after the arriving car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS342
01:24:34,00 --> 01:24:39,50
In slow motion, a valet heads over. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS343
01:24:37,00 --> 01:24:45,50
A gentle breeze lifts SOMEONE's hair as she watches a tall, handsome man exit the Porsche. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS345
01:24:49,00 --> 01:24:55,50
Sliding on a suit jacket he turns and looks at SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS346
01:24:55,00 --> 01:24:59,50
She stares, her jaw slack. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS348
01:25:08,00 --> 01:25:12,50
He hugs her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS349
01:26:03,00 --> 01:26:07,50
She heads off. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS350
01:26:10,00 --> 01:26:17,50
She climbs into her silver Mercedes. Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch The Jefferson's. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS351
01:26:47,00 --> 01:26:53,50
She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS352
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:04,50
Grinning, he retreats. SOMEONE leans against SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS353
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:38,50
She turns off the TV. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS354
01:27:35,00 --> 01:27:42,50
Now at the Santa SOMEONE SOMEONE, SOMEONE stifles a smile as she strolls with SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS355
01:27:41,00 --> 01:27:46,50
She breaks into a grin. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS357
01:28:08,00 --> 01:28:14,50
As she embraces her, a horrified look crosses his face. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS358
01:28:11,00 --> 01:28:17,50
Pulling away, SOMEONE gazes into his eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS359
01:28:21,00 --> 01:28:26,50
Later, in his bedroom, SOMEONE strips off SOMEONE's vest. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS360
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:30,50
Kissing her, he backs her up against a dresser and knocks over a lamp. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS362
01:28:29,00 --> 01:28:36,50
He gazes up at her as she slides her silky tank top over her head, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS363
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:37,50
then lowers herself over him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS364
01:28:35,00 --> 01:28:43,50
On the wall behind her, a framed painting shows a boxer with both gloves raised triumphantly in the air. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS366
01:28:41,00 --> 01:28:46,50
SOMEONE lies asleep in SOMEONE's bed. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS368
01:28:47,00 --> 01:28:53,50
Waking up, she finds a note in the vacant spot beside her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS369
01:28:51,00 --> 01:28:59,50
With a dejected look, she opens it and reads, SOMEONE, ran out for breakfast. Be right back. SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS370
01:29:00,00 --> 01:29:05,50
She shifts her thoughtful eyes, then gives a pleased look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS371
01:29:02,00 --> 01:29:08,50
Sitting up, she scoots to the edge of the bed. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS372
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:11,50
She opens a drawer in a bedside table. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS373
01:29:08,00 --> 01:29:16,50
Finding a photo of SOMEONE as a boy, dressed in a football uniform and posing on one knee, she picks it up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS374
01:29:18,00 --> 01:29:23,50
Returning it, she slides the drawer open farther. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS375
01:29:23,00 --> 01:29:28,50
She finds a copy of SOMEONE Harvey's book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS376
01:29:28,00 --> 01:29:35,50
She opens it to a bookmarked chapter with its heading circled: The 90-Day Rule. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS377
01:29:32,00 --> 01:29:37,50
Later, she sits on the steps with the book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS378
01:29:35,00 --> 01:29:40,50
SOMEONE enters, clutching a bag in his mouth. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS379
01:29:37,00 --> 01:29:43,50
He holds a box in one hand and a drink carrier in the other. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS380
01:29:44,00 --> 01:29:48,50
He sets the food down. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS381
01:29:54,00 --> 01:29:59,50
His smile fades as he sees the book in her hand. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS383
01:30:36,00 --> 01:30:41,50
SOMEONE opens his mouth as if to speak. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS384
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:52,50
She pushes him away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS385
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:13,50
Now SOMEONE's caller ID flashes, Work. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS386
01:31:31,00 --> 01:31:37,50
She heads outside where SOMEONE and Duke play basketball. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS387
01:32:12,00 --> 01:32:16,50
SOMEONE's lips stutter. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS388
01:32:13,00 --> 01:32:17,50
SOMEONE glances away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS389
01:32:20,00 --> 01:32:24,50
He gives an injured look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS390
01:32:21,00 --> 01:32:26,50
She hands him his keys and phone and he heads off. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS391
01:32:24,00 --> 01:32:30,50
Later, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE in an upscale restaurant. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS392
01:32:56,00 --> 01:32:59,50
He hugs her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS393
01:34:10,00 --> 01:34:14,50
She opens her mouth. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS394
01:34:13,00 --> 01:34:19,50
With a wry grin, he shakes his head and stands. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS395
01:34:16,00 --> 01:34:20,50
Placing a hand on her shoulder, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS396
01:34:18,00 --> 01:34:23,50
he kisses the top of her head, then leaves. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS397
01:34:20,00 --> 01:34:24,50
She gazes after him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS398
01:34:21,00 --> 01:34:26,50
Now SOMEONE enters his apartment. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS399
01:34:28,00 --> 01:34:36,50
He sees his posters and action figures sitting on the couch and coffee table along with a copy of SOMEONE Harvey's book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS400
01:34:33,00 --> 01:34:39,50
A sticky note on it reads, Found this with your stuff. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS401
01:34:37,00 --> 01:34:42,50
Boys shack, men build homes. I'm out, K. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS402
01:34:40,00 --> 01:34:50,50
Between its pages, he finds a printout of his unsubmitted résumé where the words, Blah, blah, blah, filled the blurb for the professional development section. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS403
01:34:49,00 --> 01:34:55,50
Dropping the book on the coffee table,  

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS405
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:02,50
he plops down on the couch. SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE and SOMEONE drink at the bar. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS406
01:35:47,00 --> 01:35:56,50
Daytime. At Candace's, Duke sits on the stoop with a basketball and gazes off with forlorn eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS407
01:35:53,00 --> 01:35:58,50
SOMEONE spots him from the doorway. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS408
01:35:55,00 --> 01:36:02,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE pushes a plate of half-eaten food away and rests his head on his hand. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS409
01:36:00,00 --> 01:36:04,50
His mother looks on from the kitchen. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS410
01:36:02,00 --> 01:36:09,50
As SOMEONE works at a valet station, a silver Mercedes, like SOMEONE's, pulls up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS411
01:36:06,00 --> 01:36:14,50
He uncomfortably averts his eyes, then opens the driver's side door and a businessman climbs out. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS414
01:36:15,00 --> 01:36:23,50
Later, SOMEONE gazes at a framed photo of himself and SOMEONE dressed as blue Na'vi from Avatar. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS415
01:36:21,00 --> 01:36:25,50
He sets it face down on a table. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS416
01:36:23,00 --> 01:36:28,50
At an open house, SOMEONE stares off sadly. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS417
01:36:26,00 --> 01:36:30,50
The pregnant couple enters. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS418
01:36:32,00 --> 01:36:38,50
She flashes a tight smile, which fades to a glum look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS420
01:36:43,00 --> 01:36:51,50
Following the bartender's gaze, SOMEONE sees a woman at the end of the bar. She offers him a smile. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS421
01:36:57,00 --> 01:37:06,50
Now at her apartment, SOMEONE rips down her monthly calendar, which shows almost three weeks filled with red Xs. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS422
01:37:03,00 --> 01:37:12,50
Later, SOMEONE strolls down a street, stopping as he notices a for sale sign on a food truck's windshield. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS423
01:37:11,00 --> 01:37:18,50
Now, in a dress shirt and slacks, SOMEONE joins his friends at the bar. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS425
01:37:40,00 --> 01:37:44,50
He stares at his phone. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS427
01:38:37,00 --> 01:38:41,50
He turns to SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS428
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:22,50
As they clink their shots, SOMEONE stares off with wistful eyes. He shakes his head. The others drink. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS429
01:39:30,00 --> 01:39:34,50
He downs his drink. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS430
01:39:39,00 --> 01:39:46,50
Entering the bathroom, SOMEONE checks the stalls as he makes a phone call. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS431
01:39:43,00 --> 01:39:49,50
In a kitchen, a full-figured woman answers the phone. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS432
01:40:41,00 --> 01:40:46,50
Lowering the phone, he glances around. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS433
01:41:03,00 --> 01:41:07,50
He hangs up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS434
01:41:05,00 --> 01:41:09,50
He looks skyward. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS436
01:41:19,00 --> 01:41:24,50
He claps a hand on SOMEONE's back. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS437
01:41:24,00 --> 01:41:30,50
SOMEONE stares after the departing guy, who wears a pageboy cap. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS438
01:41:27,00 --> 01:41:32,50
He checks the back of his shirt in a mirror. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS439
01:41:32,00 --> 01:41:37,50
He glances at the vacated stall. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS440
01:41:41,00 --> 01:41:46,50
Now SOMEONE returns to his friends' booth. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS441
01:41:52,00 --> 01:41:56,50
A woman passes behind him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS443
01:42:08,00 --> 01:42:15,50
SOMEONE enters his mother's house, catching her in her robe as she heads upstairs with a mug in each hand. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS444
01:42:39,00 --> 01:42:44,50
Frowning, she looks away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS445
01:42:42,00 --> 01:42:47,50
SOMEONE watches her resolutely. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS446
01:42:46,00 --> 01:42:51,50
He gives a confused look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS448
01:43:06,00 --> 01:43:11,50
He extends a bath-brush. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS449
01:43:21,00 --> 01:43:25,50
Now at the open house. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS450
01:43:23,00 --> 01:43:27,50
The pregnant couple. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS451
01:43:52,00 --> 01:43:57,50
She leads him into the backyard. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS452
01:44:32,00 --> 01:44:37,50
The couple listens in. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS453
01:44:53,00 --> 01:44:57,50
SOMEONE gazes at SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS454
01:44:58,00 --> 01:45:02,50
He drops to one knee. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS455
01:44:59,00 --> 01:45:07,50
Gina and the wife gawk. The husband smiles. SOMEONE opens and holds out a jewelry box. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS456
01:45:05,00 --> 01:45:10,50
SOMEONE blinks back tears. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS457
01:45:11,00 --> 01:45:16,50
He frowns and SOMEONE stifles a smile. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS458
01:45:24,00 --> 01:45:30,50
Taking the ring from its box, he slides it onto SOMEONE's finger. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS459
01:45:28,00 --> 01:45:32,50
As she gazes at it, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS460
01:45:29,00 --> 01:45:34,50
a tear trickles down her cheek. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS461
01:45:31,00 --> 01:45:37,50
SOMEONE lifts his glistening eyes to hers. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS462
01:45:37,00 --> 01:45:42,50
Shrugging her brow, she smirks. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS463
01:45:40,00 --> 01:45:44,50
He eyes her questioningly. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS464
01:45:49,00 --> 01:45:55,50
The three of them watch as the engaged couple kisses. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS465
01:45:52,00 --> 01:45:59,50
Now Sonia and SOMEONE enter the cafe during another open mic event.

01:46:28,00 --> 01:46:32,50
SOMEONE plays guitar. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS472
01:46:37,00 --> 01:46:43,50
As he glances at SOMEONE, some patrons follow his gaze. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS473
01:46:44,00 --> 01:46:49,50
SOMEONE follows her outside. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS475
01:47:13,00 --> 01:47:17,50
He gives a resigned look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS476
01:47:33,00 --> 01:47:37,50
He gives a desperate look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS477
01:47:54,00 --> 01:47:58,50
He locks his eyes on hers. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS478
01:48:04,00 --> 01:48:08,50
He blinks earnestly. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS479
01:48:06,00 --> 01:48:10,50
As she gazes at him, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS480
01:48:07,00 --> 01:48:13,50
her eyes filled with tears. SOMEONE steps forward and kisses her.

She wraps an arm around his neck. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS482

Now at her family reunion, SOMEONE sits at a picnic table with three women. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS483
01:48:25,00 --> 01:48:31,50
As she eats, SOMEONE stares off with a distant look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS485
01:48:45,00 --> 01:48:50,50
Duke drags SOMEONE over by the hand. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS486
01:48:48,00 --> 01:48:52,50
He waves at the table. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS488
01:49:51,00 --> 01:49:58,50
SOMEONE gives the crowd a bashful smile. Duke claps enthusiastically. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS489
01:49:57,00 --> 01:50:01,50
SOMEONE lifts his brow at SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS490
01:50:01,00 --> 01:50:05,50
She considers him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS492
01:50:10,00 --> 01:50:14,50
They kiss. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS493
01:50:11,00 --> 01:50:17,50
Later, at her apartment, SOMEONE does her makeup. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS495
01:50:41,00 --> 01:50:45,50
SOMEONE's eyes widen. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS496
01:51:00,00 --> 01:51:06,50
Now at dinner, a waiter serves her and James champagne. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS497
01:51:33,00 --> 01:51:38,50
SOMEONE glances away with thoughtful eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS498
01:51:38,00 --> 01:51:44,50
Shifting her gaze back to James, she shakes her head. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS499
01:51:54,00 --> 01:51:58,50
She closes her eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS501
01:52:03,00 --> 01:52:10,50
Stepping out of one, SOMEONE brings a tray to his friends and their significant others. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS502
01:52:11,00 --> 01:52:16,50
He beams at the applauding group, then hands out food.

He shakes his head at her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS508

He looks away.

She gives a pleading look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS510
01:53:20,00 --> 01:53:27,50
Shaking out a bag, SOMEONE ignores her. She trudges away and the customer steps up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS511
01:53:31,00 --> 01:53:36,50
Entering the truck SOMEONE gives a determined look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS512
01:53:37,00 --> 01:53:42,50
He stares slack-jawed. She gestures at his staff. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS513
01:53:44,00 --> 01:53:48,50
His two assistants leave.

Considering her, he shakes his head, then shrugs. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS516
01:54:33,00 --> 01:54:37,50
She moves closer. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS517
01:54:36,00 --> 01:54:40,50
Their lips rest mere inches apart. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS518
01:54:50,00 --> 01:54:55,50
Nodding, he glances away with a smile. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS519
01:54:53,00 --> 01:54:58,50
As he meets her gaze again, she leans in closer. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS520
01:54:56,00 --> 01:55:00,50
He cups her face and kisses her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS521
01:55:03,00 --> 01:55:09,50

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS106
00:17:52,00 --> 00:17:56,50
They sit across from each other. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS107
00:18:22,00 --> 00:18:32,50
A movie plays on a TV at a video store. SOMEONE takes an escalator down to a lower floor, observing a variety of single women. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS108
00:18:30,00 --> 00:18:35,50

00:21:44,00 --> 00:21:49,50
Now at the field office with the tech. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS120

He approaches her. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS127
00:23:40,00 --> 00:23:45,50
She rolls her eyes and he walks off with a grin. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS128
00:23:43,00 --> 00:23:49,50
Now an aerial view, roves pass downtown Los Angeles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS129
00:23:46,00 --> 00:23:53,50
At the CIA Field Office, SOMEONE and SOMEONE work at their opposing desks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS130
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:26,50
Each man turns his laptop to reveal a photo of the same woman. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS131
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:47,50
SOMEONE shuts his laptop. SOMEONE does the same. Then resumes work at his desktop computer.

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS136
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:18,50
Cut to black.

In a darkened corridor. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS144
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:00,50
SOMEONE covers SOMEONE's eyes. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS145
00:28:59,00 --> 00:29:05,50
He reveals a trapeze structure adorned with lights in the middle of a circus ring. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS146
00:29:06,00 --> 00:29:10,50
He takes her hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS147
00:29:08,00 --> 00:29:14,50
As SOMEONE swings, SOMEONE stands on a platform. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS148
00:29:18,00 --> 00:29:22,50
He swings under a domed ceiling. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS149
00:29:21,00 --> 00:29:25,50
SOMEONE grabs hold of her trapeze. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS150
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:29,50
She jumps from the platform and swings out over the net. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS151
00:29:28,00 --> 00:29:36,50
Hanging on by their legs, they grab each other's wrists. SOMEONE lets go and swings with SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS152
00:29:36,00 --> 00:29:42,50
He lets her fall and she lands on the net, bouncing high into the air. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS153
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:48,50
He lets himself fall and bounce as well. Then they roll into the middle and lie side by side. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS154
00:29:59,00 --> 00:30:04,50
As SOMEONE lies on his back, SOMEONE kisses him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS155
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:07,50
He wraps his arms around her and draws her near. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS156
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:13,50
We glimpse the couple from across the ring as they embrace, surrounded by the several strands of lights adorning the trapeze structure. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS158
00:30:17,00 --> 00:30:26,50
At home by a fireplace, SOMEONE kisses a half-naked man lying on his back near an open bottle of red wine. She smacks him.

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS161
00:31:11,00 --> 00:31:17,50
As his colleagues move on, SOMEONE shifts his gaze. Now with the tech. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS163
00:31:27,00 --> 00:31:32,50
He steps aside with his hands in his pockets. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS164
00:31:34,00 --> 00:31:42,50
A satellite view zooms in on a street, tracking an Audi convertible which loops around and parks outside a busy nightclub. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS165
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:47,50
SOMEONE hops out of the sports car and joins SOMEONE who stands in a long line to get in. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS166
00:31:54,00 --> 00:31:58,50
He leads her to the entrance. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS168
00:32:01,00 --> 00:32:06,50
SOMEONE shakes hands with the bouncer on the way in. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS169
00:32:05,00 --> 00:32:10,50
He chats with the coat check girl. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS170
00:32:11,00 --> 00:32:15,50
To a bartender. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS175
00:32:33,00 --> 00:32:37,50
They enter a VIP section. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS177
00:32:40,00 --> 00:32:45,50
A bartender hands him a bottle of wine. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS178
00:32:43,00 --> 00:32:55,50
SOMEONE turns to find SOMEONE missing from her chair. He peers across the dance floor then heads after her. Outside, as SOMEONE crosses the street, SOMEONE catches up. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS179
00:33:35,00 --> 00:33:40,50
She spots SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS180
00:33:38,00 --> 00:33:43,50
She grabs SOMEONE as he walks away. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS181
00:33:50,00 --> 00:33:56,50
She pulls him into a passionate kiss as the happy couple arrives. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS182
00:34:09,00 --> 00:34:14,50
SOMEONE glares at her. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS183
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:23,50
She glances at SOMEONE. He finally turns to SOMEONE and offers his hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS185
00:34:55,00 --> 00:35:00,50
She smacks him playfully. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS186
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:04,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch them kiss again. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS187
00:35:50,00 --> 00:35:54,50
Later at Pizzeria. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS188
00:36:20,00 --> 00:36:24,50
He smiles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS189
00:36:22,00 --> 00:36:27,50
He taps his temple and she brightens. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS190
00:36:30,00 --> 00:36:36,50
An aerial view shows the city at dawn. At the field office. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS191
00:36:38,00 --> 00:36:43,50
SOMEONE strolls cheerfully through a bullpen. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS192
00:36:42,00 --> 00:36:47,50
Turning, he finds a bald agent grinning at him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS193
00:36:44,00 --> 00:36:50,50
SOMEONE's smile fades to a comprehending scowl. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS194
00:36:47,00 --> 00:36:55,50
He marches into the work area he shares with SOMEONE and finds him sitting casually at his desk. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS196
00:37:38,00 --> 00:37:46,50
He drops the file in front of SOMEONE. It contains a photo of the blunt-featured SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS197
00:37:43,00 --> 00:37:47,50
SOMEONE sits at his own desk. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS198
00:38:11,00 --> 00:38:16,50
SOMEONE gestures bashfully. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS199
00:38:40,00 --> 00:38:44,50
SOMEONE looks up from a file. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS200
00:38:52,00 --> 00:38:56,50
Now they hold separate briefings. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS201
00:39:33,00 --> 00:39:40,50
Now in a stylish home, SOMEONE dances in a kitchen as she makes microwave popcorn. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS202
00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:46,50
A window behind her shows SOMEONE lowering to the ground on a cable. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS204
00:39:48,00 --> 00:39:57,50
Wearing shorts, a big comfy shirt, and a ponytail, she struts into the living room and turns on a flat screen TV. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS205
00:39:54,00 --> 00:40:00,50
Behind her, SOMEONE creeps in and ducks behind a couch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS206
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:03,50
SOMEONE returns to the kitchen obliviously. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS207
00:40:00,00 --> 00:40:07,50
Getting to his feet, SOMEONE peers at her bookshelf and notices models of vintage sports cars. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS208
00:40:05,00 --> 00:40:13,50
In the kitchen, she swivels her hips as she wipes out her popcorn bowl. As she leaves the kitchen, he darts out. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS209
00:40:16,00 --> 00:40:24,50
She passes stairs, steps through a doorway, and shuts it behind her. SOMEONE darts down the stairs. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS210
00:40:22,00 --> 00:40:29,50
He glides over to a lamp and sticks a tiny device under the shade's cross-beamed frame. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS211
00:40:27,00 --> 00:40:34,50
Noticing a framed poster for a Gustav Klimt Exhibit, he studies it closely. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS212
00:40:31,00 --> 00:40:39,50
SOMEONE ducks around a doorway and hides as SOMEONE comes out and eyes an open laptop. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS213
00:40:38,00 --> 00:40:45,50
SOMEONE notices a website for a pet shelter on her browser. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS214
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:48,50
SOMEONE waves her hands in the air as she dances to her microwave. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS215
00:40:46,00 --> 00:40:54,50
SOMEONE ducks behind the kitchen island then darts around a corner as she takes out her popcorn. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS216
00:40:54,00 --> 00:40:59,50
Behind her, SOMEONE dashes off outside. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS218
00:41:06,00 --> 00:41:13,50
Now at his desk, SOMEONE throws a crumpled paper ball at a waste basket and misses. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS219
00:41:10,00 --> 00:41:16,50
A paper ball flying from another direction goes in. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS220
00:41:13,00 --> 00:41:21,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE who blows on his fingers like a gun barrel and flashes a cocky smile. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS221
00:41:18,00 --> 00:41:23,50
SOMEONE tries again and his paper ball goes in. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS222
00:41:21,00 --> 00:41:26,50
Their feet on their desks, they take turns throwing. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS223
00:41:38,00 --> 00:41:44,50
Now a marquee reads, The Penthouse - Beautiful Girls Nightly. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS224
00:41:53,00 --> 00:41:59,50
As a bouncer moves aside, SOMEONE faces his partner. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS225
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:04,50
He sniffs SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS226
00:42:06,00 --> 00:42:13,50
Leaning on SOMEONE, SOMEONE staggers drunkenly into a backroom where men play cards. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS227
00:42:30,00 --> 00:42:35,50
SOMEONE glares at him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS228
00:42:40,00 --> 00:42:45,50
SOMEONE stands revealing his powerful build. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS229
00:42:46,00 --> 00:42:53,50
SOMEONE's poker buddies draw guns and fires as he flees. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS230
00:42:50,00 --> 00:42:55,50
Dropping to the floor, the agent shoot their assailants. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS232
00:43:00,00 --> 00:43:08,50
As he runs through a doorway, a bald man tosses SOMEONE a shotgun then attacks SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS233
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:11,50
The agent fights back, wrapping a payphone cord around his neck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS234
00:43:10,00 --> 00:43:20,50
SOMEONE drops to the floor as SOMEONE shoots. The blast misses him and SOMEONE flees. SOMEONE and SOMEONE give chase, dropping the bald man. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS235
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:24,50
Reaching the main floor, SOMEONE trips then draws an ankle pistol and aims. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS237
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:37,50
SOMEONE forces a patron down and SOMEONE shot misses again. SOMEONE dashes over the bar then somersaults across the table. As SOMEONE reaches the dancer stage, SOMEONE knocks him down and falls away. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS238
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:46,50
Arriving, SOMEONE disarms SOMEONE and slams him against the pole. SOMEONE charges but SOMEONE kicks him away. SOMEONE forces SOMEONE down and SOMEONE punches him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS239
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:51,50
While his partner straps SOMEONE's neck and cuffs him to the pole, SOMEONE holds him at gun point. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS241
00:43:55,00 --> 00:44:00,50
Later, they haul SOMEONE into the field office. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS242
00:44:03,00 --> 00:44:07,50
I'm not saying anything. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS243
00:44:13,00 --> 00:44:19,50
SOMEONE eyes his cell. It reads, Boyles - urgent check in. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS244
00:44:16,00 --> 00:44:22,50
SOMEONE gets a text from SOMEONE reading, mission alert. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS247
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:55,50
Now at SOMEONE's house. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS248
00:45:11,00 --> 00:45:16,50
She shows the photo of SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS249
00:45:28,00 --> 00:45:35,50
As SOMEONE spies on the women from a surveillance truck, SOMEONE burst in on him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS250
00:46:54,00 --> 00:46:59,50
Both men listen worriedly. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS251
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:11,50
SOMEONE faces his cackling friend. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS252
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:20,50
His smile vanishes. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS253
00:47:44,00 --> 00:47:49,50
The men meet separately with their team leaders. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS255
00:48:00,00 --> 00:48:04,50
SOMEONE rides in the Camaro with her. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS256
00:48:10,00 --> 00:48:18,50
A spy drone flies into view behind them. Tilting his side mirror, SOMEONE spots it. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS257
00:48:15,00 --> 00:48:23,50
From a surveillance room, SOMEONE watches footage from its camera. SOMEONE sticks up his middle finger. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS258
00:48:23,00 --> 00:48:32,50
Behind his back, he discreetly draws a gun then makes a show of resting his hand behind SOMEONE's seat back. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS259
00:48:29,00 --> 00:48:34,50
He shoots the drone, destroying it. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS260
00:48:38,00 --> 00:48:45,50
SOMEONE raises both hands, SOMEONE grabs the wheel. The briefings continue. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS261
00:48:56,00 --> 00:49:02,50
Now SOMEONE takes SOMEONE to an enormous art vault. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS262
00:48:59,00 --> 00:49:06,50
In an alcove, several paintings by Klimt stand propped against crates. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS263
00:49:20,00 --> 00:49:26,50
At a remote location, SOMEONE speaks into a headset. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS265
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:06,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS266
00:50:03,00 --> 00:50:08,50
With SOMEONE, SOMEONE giggles mischievously. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS268
00:50:27,00 --> 00:50:31,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE laughs. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS269
00:50:35,00 --> 00:50:40,50
He takes her to a draped painting. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS270
00:50:39,00 --> 00:50:45,50
He unveils it, revealing Klimt's romantic masterpiece, The Kiss. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS271
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:52,50
It depicts a man kissing a woman's face. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS272
00:50:54,00 --> 00:51:01,50
She takes SOMEONE's arm as she gazes wistfully at the stylized yet tender image. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS273
00:50:58,00 --> 00:51:05,50
The agent's expression softens affectionately and he faces the painting. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS274
00:51:09,00 --> 00:51:14,50
They share a smile. Later, a phone call. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS275
00:51:18,00 --> 00:51:22,50
In surveillance. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS276
00:51:27,00 --> 00:51:33,50
SOMEONE brings up a video feed from SOMEONE's house. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS277
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:53,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS278
00:51:50,00 --> 00:51:55,50
Now he takes SOMEONE to a dog shelter. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS279
00:52:08,00 --> 00:52:13,50
He high fives a boy. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS280
00:52:22,00 --> 00:52:27,50
She faces a tiny mutt's cage. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS281
00:52:26,00 --> 00:52:31,50
SOMEONE starts to open it. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS282
00:52:36,00 --> 00:52:44,50
As SOMEONE moves on to the terrier's cage, the tiny mutt springs out and attacks SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS283
00:52:46,00 --> 00:52:54,50
The terrier jumps up and down in front of SOMEONE. With great effort, SOMEONE wrestles the mutt into submission. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS284
00:52:52,00 --> 00:52:57,50
Turning, SOMEONE smiles fondly at them. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS285
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:59,50
He puts the dog back in its cage. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS286
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:06,50
SOMEONE brushes more hair off his shirt. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS288
00:53:26,00 --> 00:53:31,50
Later, SOMEONE spies on SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS289
00:53:47,00 --> 00:53:52,50
SOMEONE frowns. Now at a paintball park. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS290
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:14,50
SOMEONE sweeps curtains of netting apart revealing men and boys on a paintball field. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS292
00:54:13,00 --> 00:54:18,50
He swings out from a rail, kicking a man down. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS293
00:54:16,00 --> 00:54:21,50
He disarms another. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS294
00:54:18,00 --> 00:54:26,50
Crouching on a deck, he shoots the players hiding beneath then beacons SOMEONE with the wave. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS295
00:54:26,00 --> 00:54:30,50
She fumbles with goggles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS296
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:36,50
Now they peek out from behind a partition. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS297
00:54:37,00 --> 00:54:45,50
SOMEONE whips around and shoots players surrounding him. He hits two in their helmets. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS298
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:48,50
In a bunker. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS299
00:54:47,00 --> 00:54:54,50
SOMEONE drops onto the roof and throws in a canister. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS300
00:54:52,00 --> 00:55:03,50
He swings away, leaving the kids staring from the bunker windows. Blue paint sprays out from inside. SOMEONE leaps from post to post up to a tower with a flag. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS301
00:55:02,00 --> 00:55:09,50
He yanks a man from the tower, grabs the flag and proudly shows it to SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS302
00:55:09,00 --> 00:55:13,50
He nimbly climbs down to her. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS303
00:55:36,00 --> 00:55:41,50
Her gun shoots him in the crouch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS304
00:55:52,00 --> 00:55:56,50
He straightens his face flushed. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS305
00:55:56,00 --> 00:56:00,50
At the gymboree. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS306
00:57:00,00 --> 00:57:04,50
SOMEONE shakes his hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS307
00:57:03,00 --> 00:57:07,50
SOMEONE checks his watch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS308
00:57:10,00 --> 00:57:14,50
Later, with Agent SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS309
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:20,50
Now candles filled SOMEONE's loft. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS310
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:38,50
As they kiss, a monitor in the CIA surveillance room shows their glowing heat signature. SOMEONE scowls. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS311
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:42,50
A tech wearing glasses stands behind him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS312
00:57:41,00 --> 00:57:45,50
SOMEONE presses a remote. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS313
00:57:43,00 --> 00:57:53,50
In the loft, the overhead fires sprinklers go off, extinguishing the candles and drenching SOMEONE and SOMEONE. SOMEONE smirks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS314
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:56,50
On another day, SOMEONE walks with Agent SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS315
00:57:56,00 --> 00:58:01,50
At SOMEONE's pad. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS316
00:58:08,00 --> 00:58:15,50
An old dog wheezes on his couch as they stop and kiss. SOMEONE pulls away. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS317
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:27,50
She exists. SOMEONE watches her go then excitedly grabs a wine bottle and two glasses and hurries over to the coffee table. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS318
00:58:26,00 --> 00:58:31,50
He sets them down then presses the remote. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS319
00:58:30,00 --> 00:58:36,50
He quickly lights a candle then almost sits down on his new pet. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS320
00:58:36,00 --> 00:58:41,50
He shoos the dog off the couch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS322
00:58:42,00 --> 00:58:49,50
He pulls a dart from his neck. Looking out the window, he sees SOMEONE on the next roof. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS323
00:58:49,00 --> 00:59:01,50
Holding a tranquilizer rifle, his partner communicates with him using military hand signals then disappears. SOMEONE's knees slowly buckle and he collapses to the couch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS324
00:59:04,00 --> 00:59:10,50
As he falls unconscious, SOMEONE returns. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS325
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:21,50
The next day, SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand in an elevator. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS326
00:59:25,00 --> 00:59:32,50
As they both try to exit at the same time, they get log-jammed. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS327
00:59:55,00 --> 00:59:59,50
They enter an interrogation room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS328
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:18,50
He brandish his pliers. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS329
01:00:27,00 --> 01:00:32,50
Sitting handcuffed in a chair, SOMEONE chuckles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS330
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:34,50
SOMEONE glares at SOMEONE 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS331
01:00:31,00 --> 01:00:35,50
who turns to their prisoner. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS333
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:43,50
Sooner or later he'll be coming for you. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS335
01:00:45,00 --> 01:00:50,50
He glowers at SOMEONE's poker face. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS336
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:55,50
He turns his harsh eyes on SOMEONE who gives a cool smirk. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS337
01:00:52,00 --> 01:01:06,50
Now a satellite view zooms out from the CIA Field Office rapidly relocates the Los Angeles harbor and zooms in. At a dock, a henchman clasps hands with Heinrich and helps him disembark off a fishing boat. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS338
01:01:07,00 --> 01:01:11,50
I'm sorry about SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS339
01:01:09,00 --> 01:01:15,50
They get in one of two black Chevy Suburban’s waiting at a curb. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS340
01:01:12,00 --> 01:01:18,50
As the cars pull out, the picture fades to black. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS341
01:01:19,00 --> 01:01:25,50
Now SOMEONE brings SOMEONE to his grandparents' estate. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS342
01:01:22,00 --> 01:01:28,50
His little nephew spins around with a bucket on his head then collapses. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS344
01:01:48,00 --> 01:01:53,50
She pulls SOMEONE away. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS345
01:01:50,00 --> 01:01:56,50
Left behind with a pie in his hand, SOMEONE lets out a sigh. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS346
01:01:54,00 --> 01:02:00,50
Nana walks SOMEONE out to a stable where photographs clutter a wall. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS347
01:02:46,00 --> 01:02:50,50
At a family dinner. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS348
01:03:25,00 --> 01:03:30,50
SOMEONE raises her glass of white wine. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS349
01:03:31,00 --> 01:03:35,50
Everyone toasts. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS350
01:03:32,00 --> 01:03:37,50
That night, SOMEONE walks SOMEONE to her house. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS351
01:03:56,00 --> 01:04:01,50
They both glance away shyly then look each other in the eyes. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS352
01:03:59,00 --> 01:04:03,50
SOMEONE chuckles nervously. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS353
01:04:12,00 --> 01:04:18,50
The two surveillance teams watch from the CIA. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS354
01:04:16,00 --> 01:04:33,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE burst into her house. Kissing hungrily as they remove their coats. They start tearing off each other's clothes. She straddles his thighs as he lifts her onto the kitchen island. He whips off his blue button down shirt. Agent SOMEONE watches the video feed. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS355
01:04:34,00 --> 01:04:42,50
SOMEONE lifts SOMEONE's dress off over her head. She reclines with a sultry smile. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS356
01:04:39,00 --> 01:04:51,50
Back at the CIA Field Office, SOMEONE's three colleagues crane their necks to watch. As SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie kissing on the kitchen island, the picture fades to black. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS357
01:04:51,00 --> 01:04:57,50
The next morning, he lies asleep in her bed. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS358
01:04:54,00 --> 01:05:01,50
Dressed for work, SOMEONE tiptoes out from her bathroom and gathers her things. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS359
01:05:59,00 --> 01:06:04,50
He winces. SOMEONE makes a call as she heads out. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS360
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:42,50
At the CIA. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS361
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:03,50
Agent SOMEONE reluctantly takes it out of his breast pocket. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS363
01:07:16,00 --> 01:07:22,50
Avoiding eye contact, SOMEONE nods tensely. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS364
01:07:31,00 --> 01:07:38,50
He chucks the disk in the trash and storms off. Now SOMEONE watches Titanic. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS365
01:07:36,00 --> 01:07:44,50
Standing at the prow of the ship, SOMEONE Winslet looks out over the water. SOMEONE smiles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS366
01:07:46,00 --> 01:07:53,50
He goes to an elevator door and answers it to reveal a sexy woman in a flight attendant's uniform. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS367
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:23,50
SOMEONE gives a shock gape then nods and smiles politely. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS368
01:08:21,00 --> 01:08:26,50
The elevator doors slide shut. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS369
01:08:23,00 --> 01:08:30,50
SOMEONE closes his eyes and lifts his brow then returns to the living room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS370
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:32,50
Pausing in tracks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS371
01:08:30,00 --> 01:08:35,50
He looks back over his shoulder toward the elevator. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS373
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:13,50
The satellite view zooms out from the CIA Field Office. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS374
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:19,50
It shifts to James Monroe Elementary. SOMEONE comes out from the school. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS375
01:09:19,00 --> 01:09:25,50
SOMEONE stands by smiling as SOMEONE gives his son a hug. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS376
01:09:30,00 --> 01:09:35,50
SOMEONE monitors the conversation. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS377
01:09:50,00 --> 01:09:59,50
At the Smart Consumer offices, SOMEONE sits before a toy fire truck. SOMEONE gives him a hammer and lets him smash it to pieces. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS378
01:09:57,00 --> 01:10:03,50
Later, the three spray water at some test windows. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS380
01:10:04,00 --> 01:10:08,50
They spray him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS381
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:10,50
A water fight ensues between all three of them. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS382
01:10:08,00 --> 01:10:14,50
Back in the surveillance room, SOMEONE paces as he monitors the scene. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS384
01:10:16,00 --> 01:10:20,50
She waves from his truck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS385
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:24,50
SOMEONE's ex comes out of her and watches him give SOMEONE a hug. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS386
01:10:24,00 --> 01:10:29,50
SOMEONE smiles as he returns to his truck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS387
01:10:26,00 --> 01:10:31,50
Back in the surveillance room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS388
01:10:40,00 --> 01:10:48,50
On screen, a satellite zooms in on SOMEONE's vehicle as it pulls over to the side of the road. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS389
01:10:45,00 --> 01:10:52,50
SOMEONE sits and watches SOMEONE and SOMEONE's heat signatures in the front seat. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS391
01:11:00,00 --> 01:11:07,50
As SOMEONE pulls away, their noses graze and their lips linger an inch apart. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS392
01:11:06,00 --> 01:11:11,50
They meet in a tender kiss. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS393
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:15,50
SOMEONE shuts his eyes and bows his head. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS394
01:11:13,00 --> 01:11:20,50
Now the couple barges into SOMEONE's house locked in a passionate embrace. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS395
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:30,50
As SOMEONE lifts SOMEONE up onto a console table, he discreetly removes the bug from the lamp and throws it on the floor. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS396
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:35,50
As SOMEONE crashes it under his shoe, the surveillance team loses one of their angles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS397
01:11:33,00 --> 01:11:40,50
SOMEONE leans SOMEONE over a dining table and reaches into a center piece. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS401
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:00,50
SOMEONE throws down a pair of headphones. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS402
01:12:00,00 --> 01:12:06,50
Now SOMEONE lays SOMEONE down on the couch. He kisses her neck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS403
01:12:10,00 --> 01:12:15,50
SOMEONE listens in. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS404
01:12:18,00 --> 01:12:24,50
SOMEONE tenderly strokes his cheek. In the surveillance room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS405
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:33,50
SOMEONE's head sinks and he covers his eyes. Daytime, at SOMEONE's house. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS407
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:13,50
She lifts her son onto her lap. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS408
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:22,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand at their desks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS409
01:13:46,00 --> 01:13:53,50
As SOMEONE takes a clip from his gun, SOMEONE packs up his belongings in a file box. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS411
01:14:10,00 --> 01:14:15,50
SOMEONE takes his cellphone from his pocket. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS412
01:14:36,00 --> 01:14:41,50
Keeping his stare on SOMEONE, SOMEONE ends the call. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS413
01:14:41,00 --> 01:14:47,50
SOMEONE shuts his laptop. Pockets his phone and grabs his jacket. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS414
01:14:50,00 --> 01:14:57,50
As SOMEONE strides out of the room, SOMEONE stands motionless at his box of belongings. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS415
01:14:55,00 --> 01:15:02,50
Later, SOMEONE enters the surveillance area with the box under his arm. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS416
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:05,50
He sets it down next to SOMEONE watching surveillance footage. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS418
01:15:24,00 --> 01:15:29,50
SOMEONE glances back at the footage and stops. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS419
01:15:28,00 --> 01:15:34,50
The camera zooms in from a wide view to a close up of the truck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS420
01:15:31,00 --> 01:15:36,50
SOMEONE's eyes narrow. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS421
01:15:41,00 --> 01:15:45,50
They see a car parked behind the truck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS422
01:15:44,00 --> 01:15:51,50
The tech complies. A zoomed in image clarifies, revealing the shadowy face of the driver. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS423
01:15:51,00 --> 01:15:56,50
SOMEONE rushes out of the room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS424
01:16:01,00 --> 01:16:06,50
SOMEONE approaches. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS425
01:16:42,00 --> 01:16:46,50
She heads up some stairs. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS426
01:16:48,00 --> 01:16:54,50
SOMEONE waves. Now SOMEONE is bare feet, move up and down. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS427
01:16:52,00 --> 01:16:57,50
She rests from using her fitness ball. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS429
01:17:23,00 --> 01:17:29,50
As SOMEONE nods and complies, SOMEONE gives him a slap on the cheek. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS430
01:17:31,00 --> 01:17:37,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE then delivers a fast right hook. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS431
01:17:34,00 --> 01:17:40,50
In a posh ladies room, SOMEONE controls her breath. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS432
01:17:37,00 --> 01:17:49,50
In the chic restaurant, customers clear out as the two men brawl. SOMEONE sends SOMEONE rolling over a table then throws a knife into a leather chair by SOMEONE's head. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS433
01:17:51,00 --> 01:17:56,50
She sees food on her gum line. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS435
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:06,50
SOMEONE stuns SOMEONE with a throat punch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS436
01:18:04,00 --> 01:18:09,50
SOMEONE wheels a coat rack like a quarterstaff. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS437
01:18:08,00 --> 01:18:14,50
SOMEONE uses the pole to ram SOMEONE backward through a glass partition. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS439
01:18:13,00 --> 01:18:22,50
She mops her cleavage. Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE scrap right over a balcony. They plummet 20 feet onto a table below. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS440
01:18:20,00 --> 01:18:25,50
In the ladies room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS441
01:18:24,00 --> 01:18:31,50
Now bloody face then lying on glass shards, SOMEONE feebly throws a fork at SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS442
01:18:32,00 --> 01:18:36,50
SOMEONE comes down the stairs. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS443
01:19:04,00 --> 01:19:09,50
With disappointment in her eyes, SOMEONE turns away. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS444
01:19:09,00 --> 01:19:14,50
As she clears out, the two battered man wilt. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS445
01:19:11,00 --> 01:19:17,50
SOMEONE joins SOMEONE in her convertible bug. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS446
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:25,50
SOMEONE hands her a sippy cup. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS447
01:19:37,00 --> 01:19:46,50
An SUV bumps them from behind. A second bumps them from the front. Trapping the car. Two men approach, one is Heinrich. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS448
01:19:50,00 --> 01:19:57,50
Heinrich signals an accomplice. In the trashed restaurant, the guys stand up. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS449
01:19:58,00 --> 01:20:02,50
Now they exit to the sidewalk. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS450
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:10,50
It's SOMEONE's cell calling. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS451
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:32,50
Three SUVs escort SOMEONE's VW. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS452
01:20:44,00 --> 01:20:49,50
SOMEONE manipulates his handheld. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS454
01:20:58,00 --> 01:21:02,50
SOMEONE flings the valet from the car. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS456
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:14,50
SOMEONE takes the mic. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS457
01:21:12,00 --> 01:21:20,50
On the freeway, SOMEONE's convertible is escorted on three sides. The passenger side is unguarded. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS458
01:21:24,00 --> 01:21:38,50
As the Jeep comes up fast on the VW's unguarded side, SOMEONE grips the roll bar and leans out. He leaps aboard the convertible and punches a thug in back, sending him tumbling. SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS461
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:50,50
SOMEONE shoots the tire on SOMEONE's car which veers off the road and catches air over a decorative man-made lake. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS462
01:21:51,00 --> 01:21:58,50
The huge splash blocks everything from view except a free flying license plate. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS463
01:21:56,00 --> 01:22:02,50
The water calms. SOMEONE sits safely in the buoyant bobbing bug. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS464
01:21:59,00 --> 01:22:19,50
On the road, a gunman in one SUV fires on the jeep which evades to the right. Heinrich fires from another SUV. A return shot from SOMEONE tags Heinrich's shoulder. His car halts and he scolds, Drive you idiot. His driver slumps dead. Heinrich shoves the body out and drives on. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS466
01:22:26,00 --> 01:22:35,50
In a parking garage, two SUVs race their way. SOMEONE reverses as they advance head on. He beckons SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS468
01:22:42,00 --> 01:22:54,50
The Jeep does a tight skidding 180, SOMEONE nearly falls out but SOMEONE pulls him back in. As one SUV gunman aims at them, SOMEONE pulls his trigger and pegs the guy. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS469
01:22:59,00 --> 01:23:12,50
With a lug wrench, SOMEONE smashes the window of an enemy driver beside them. Hooks the stirring wheel and yanks. The SUV hits a column and explodes. Meanwhile, SOMEONE's son watches TV. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS472
01:23:26,00 --> 01:23:46,50
Chased by another SUV, SOMEONE throws a gas jug from the Jeep. As it bounces under the pursuer's bumper, the agents shoot it and it explodes. The SUV gets thrown upside down. Seeing the road's end, SOMEONE breaks. The Jeep spins to a sidelong halt within inches of the sheer drop. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS473
01:23:43,00 --> 01:23:48,50
SOMEONE sways outward precariously. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS474
01:23:45,00 --> 01:23:51,50
Two traffic cones plunge to the highway below. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS475
01:23:48,00 --> 01:23:54,50
SOMEONE looks from SOMEONE to SOMEONE. His gaze intense and thoughtful. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS476
01:23:52,00 --> 01:23:56,50
He addresses SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS477
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:27,50
Heinrich's SUV speeds toward them. Standing on the road, SOMEONE and SOMEONE both fire at it. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS478
01:24:24,00 --> 01:24:30,50
SOMEONE stands back by the Jeep, visible between the two agents. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS481
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:45,50
The agents kneel. As the SUV rounds closer, they fire. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS482
01:24:43,00 --> 01:24:51,50
A deploying airbag wallops Heinrich's face and he careens into a mobile construction light. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS483
01:24:48,00 --> 01:24:56,50
The blast sends the SUV rolling sideways toward the road's unfinished end. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS484
01:24:53,00 --> 01:25:05,50
In slow motion, SOMEONE and SOMEONE each race to one side. They both beacon SOMEONE, urging her to clear out of the way. But the tumbling SUV bares down swiftly. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS485
01:25:02,00 --> 01:25:09,50
Scene from the ground, the SUV and Jeep barrel over the edge and explode on impact. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS486
01:25:07,00 --> 01:25:14,50
A bird's-eye-view shows the black smoke hiding the end of the unfinished roadway. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS487
01:25:11,00 --> 01:25:18,50
The smoke thins and SOMEONE becomes visible, semi-reclined on the road. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS488
01:25:16,00 --> 01:25:21,50
Opposite him, SOMEONE holds SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS489
01:25:23,00 --> 01:25:28,50
SOMEONE's squints at them, stunned and knowing. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS490
01:25:27,00 --> 01:25:34,50
SOMEONE tenderly caresses her hair and SOMEONE peers longingly at him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS491
01:25:31,00 --> 01:25:37,50
As SOMEONE looks on, they both turn their attention to him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS492
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:41,50
He resiliently straightens his posture and gives a few curt nods of his head. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS493
01:25:42,00 --> 01:25:50,50
All three notice the news chopper. Meanwhile, SOMEONE's son and ex-wife gawk at the TV. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS494
01:25:56,00 --> 01:26:02,50
Later, a paramedic faces SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS495
01:26:01,00 --> 01:26:10,50
Wrapped in a blanket, SOMEONE goes to SOMEONE who sits at the rear of an ambulance. He stands and they kiss each other's cheeks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS496
01:26:14,00 --> 01:26:18,50
He looks to his friend. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS498
01:26:30,00 --> 01:26:35,50
SOMEONE gives him a warm smile. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS499
01:26:40,00 --> 01:26:45,50
SOMEONE lowers his gaze and nods shyly. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS500
01:26:46,00 --> 01:26:52,50
Heading off, he pauses and turns back to face his approaching friend. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS501
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:03,50
SOMEONE adjusts his wrist watch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS502
01:27:04,00 --> 01:27:09,50
SOMEONE regards his friend with a concerned frown. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS503
01:27:12,00 --> 01:27:15,50
They hug. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS504
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:23,50
They part and SOMEONE heads off. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS505
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:29,50
Rejoining SOMEONE, SOMEONE wraps his arms around her. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS506
01:27:32,00 --> 01:27:38,50
His lips meet hers in a smoldering kiss. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS507
01:27:39,00 --> 01:27:44,50
They rock back and forth lingering in the embrace. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS508
01:27:41,00 --> 01:27:48,50
Looking up at SOMEONE, SOMEONE shakes her head knowingly and smiles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS509
01:27:51,00 --> 01:28:00,50
As they enjoy another kiss, we drift up and away from the unfinished overpass and gaze out over the city. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS510
01:27:57,00 --> 01:28:05,50
Now in the SOMEONE Arts Dojo, SOMEONE and SOMEONE face off again as both of their fathers look on. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS511
01:28:05,00 --> 01:28:14,50
As SOMEONE charges, SOMEONE swings his leg over the bigger boy's arm and flips him to the mat. He runs proudly to SOMEONE. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS513
01:28:25,00 --> 01:28:30,50
Leaning on SOMEONE, the man obeys with effort. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS514
01:28:34,00 --> 01:28:38,50
SOMEONE pats his back. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS515
01:28:39,00 --> 01:28:46,50
As SOMEONE steps away, SOMEONE shyly approaches his ex who waits for him in a doorway. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS516
01:28:45,00 --> 01:28:51,50
She smiles and glances away. Her wide eyes glistening. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS517
01:28:56,00 --> 01:29:01,50
He presents himself to her humbly. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS518
01:28:58,00 --> 01:29:05,50
Leaning against the door frame, she steps forward and extends a hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS519
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:12,50
SOMEONE's brow lifts in a delighted smile, he shakes her hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS520
01:29:28,00 --> 01:29:35,50
With a tearful smile, she gestures SOMEONE to follow her as she goes over to her son. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS521
01:29:34,00 --> 01:29:41,50
In slow motion, the reunited family walks down a hallway together. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS522
01:29:40,00 --> 01:29:47,50
SOMEONE lays a hand on SOMEONE's back, gently ushering her through a doorway. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS523
01:29:44,00 --> 01:29:50,50
He follows with a hopeful gaze. Fade to black. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS524
01:29:47,00 --> 01:29:53,50
Now a military grade helicopter flies out at a night time mission. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS525
01:29:54,00 --> 01:29:58,50
Inside, SOMEONE answers his cell. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS526
01:29:57,00 --> 01:30:01,50
In a sporty convertible. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS527
01:30:37,00 --> 01:30:41,50
In the helicopter. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS528
01:30:44,00 --> 01:30:49,50
They jump up and down, a hatch lowers. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS529
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:53,50
SOMEONE checks SOMEONE's chute. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS530
01:31:22,00 --> 01:31:26,50
SOMEONE stares at him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS16
00:02:54,00 --> 00:02:58,50
Now, a title appears. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS17
00:02:57,00 --> 00:03:02,50
Boston. Zacum Bridge at sunrise. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS18
00:03:01,00 --> 00:03:10,50
In a residential neighborhood. Words appear, 5 Years Later. SOMEONE steps on to the porch of a modest three-story. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS19
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:14,50
Now, at a junk yard. SOMEONE buys a waist-high tire. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS21
00:03:19,00 --> 00:03:25,50
Is guarding a grand entryway. Arched ironwork above reads "Park Zoo".  

ZOOKEEPER_DVS22
00:03:23,00 --> 00:03:30,50
Now, SOMEONE drives a golf cart with the tire in back. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS23
00:03:32,00 --> 00:03:41,50
Habitat enclosure. SOMEONE lowers a drawbridge over a moat and walks over to it. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS24
00:03:40,00 --> 00:03:45,50
He takes the monkey's hand. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS25
00:03:53,00 --> 00:03:58,50
Who wears a patch over one eye. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS28
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:40,50
Worker dumps his bucket of lettuce over a waist-high wall and into the pit. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS29
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:46,50
He unlocks a door which opens at the pit's floor level. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS30
00:04:48,00 --> 00:05:02,50
He rolls the tire into a barren habitat. A single shaft of sunlight shines down from the pit's high opening into the otherwise stark enclosure where a gorilla sits with its back to the door. SOMEONE hangs the tire from a rope on a tree. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS32
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:20,50
He Stands then stumbles back over. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS35
00:05:24,00 --> 00:05:31,50
Later, in a lab, a willowy, SOMEONE. Long haired woman places an eagle in a cage. She sees SOMEONE standing at a dry erase board labeled Things to do. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS36
00:05:30,00 --> 00:05:34,50
He writes, Fix SOMEONE's tree. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS40
00:06:39,00 --> 00:06:44,50
A heart monitor shows a flat line. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS42
00:07:03,00 --> 00:07:07,50
He opens a drawer and rifles through it. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS44
00:07:23,00 --> 00:07:28,50
He gets his hand down the lioness’s throat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS45
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:39,50
SOMEONE pulls out a crushed Red Bull can. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS46
00:07:49,00 --> 00:07:56,50
That night, a banner hanging over a party over the zoo reads, Congratulations. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS49
00:08:20,00 --> 00:08:27,50
His hand and pulls her into a tight embrace. Her eyes widen. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS50
00:08:41,00 --> 00:08:47,50
He gives a serious look. SOMEONE smiles politely. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS54
00:10:03,00 --> 00:10:13,50
In the icy stand behind him. Scanning the crowd, SOMEONE spots SOMEONE. In his perspective, she appears to pull away from the others around her. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS55
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:17,50
SOMEONE's lips twitch. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS57
00:11:12,00 --> 00:11:18,50
Venom cringes while Frankie hits play on a boom box. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS58
00:11:21,00 --> 00:11:27,50
SOMEONE strides over to SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS59
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:34,50
He catches SOMEONE eyeing SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS60
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:39,50
Meanwhile, by the giraffe's enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS61
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,50
He perks up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS62
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:41,50
SOMEONE, the Monkey watches them chat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS63
00:12:39,00 --> 00:12:45,50
Holding the porcupine, SOMEONE turns away. He yanks the quill out. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS68
00:13:43,00 --> 00:13:57,50
SOMEONE flinches. Smiling, she dabs his cheek. He stares at her with lovelorn eyes. She returns a tender look. SOMEONE, the Monkey watches. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS69
00:14:03,00 --> 00:14:08,50
She gives a flirty smile. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS71
00:14:33,00 --> 00:14:41,50
She leaves. As SOMEONE stares after her, Floyd shoots a quill into his forehead. SOMEONE chuckles. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS72
00:14:39,00 --> 00:14:48,50
SOMEONE winces and grits his teeth. He pulls out the quill. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS76
00:15:00,00 --> 00:15:10,50
A net swings from a horizontal arm at its top. The monkey leaps onto it, climbs down the pole and lands in SOMEONE's enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS77
00:15:08,00 --> 00:15:13,50
SOMEONE creeps past a man-made waterfall. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS78
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:16,50
The panel on it. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS79
00:15:13,00 --> 00:15:20,50
Swinging it open, he finds a power box inside and  

ZOOKEEPER_DVS80
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:26,50
He flips a switch. A dog is licking himself. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS81
00:15:27,00 --> 00:15:39,50
on just his hind legs, SOMEONE scurries down a path to a set of heavy iron double doors. He climbs up to the keyhole, glances around, then picks the lock. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS82
00:15:38,00 --> 00:15:42,50
Tilts and the doors swing open. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS83
00:16:08,00 --> 00:16:18,50
She stretches her neck into another enclosure where the rest of the animals gather at the base of a rock ledge. A lion steps out. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS84
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:14,50
He eyes. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS85
00:18:54,00 --> 00:19:02,50
The next day, SOMEONE peers into SOMEONE's pit to find SOMEONE hanging a giant whiffle ball from the tree. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS86
00:19:12,00 --> 00:19:17,50
He spins it. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS87
00:19:20,00 --> 00:19:25,50
With a smile, SOMEONE heads away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS88
00:19:25,00 --> 00:19:30,50
SOMEONE keeps his back to him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS89
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:40,50
Later, with the giraffe. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS92
00:19:58,00 --> 00:20:07,50
SOMEONE gnaws on a carrot as he watches SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk away. The giraffe licks it and he spits it out. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS93
00:20:05,00 --> 00:20:11,50
She walks away from him and looks at the monkey. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS94
00:20:10,00 --> 00:20:14,50
SOMEONE gives a thumbs up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS97
00:20:29,00 --> 00:20:34,50
A wire basket drops from his hand. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS98
00:20:49,00 --> 00:20:54,50
Flailing his arms. The giraffe looks on. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS99
00:20:55,00 --> 00:21:00,50
He drops into the rock ledge and lands on his back. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS100
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:11,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE board the golf cart. SOMEONE peeks over the rock ledge and watches SOMEONE struggle to his feet. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS101
00:21:09,00 --> 00:21:14,50
Lion steps away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS104
00:21:49,00 --> 00:21:53,50
His house and shuts the door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS105
00:21:51,00 --> 00:21:56,50
Through his window blinds. On TV 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS106
00:21:53,00 --> 00:21:59,50
Teenage witch listens to her talking cat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS107
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:41,50
The next morning at the zoo, SOMEONE peeks into the lion enclosure and finds SOMEONE lying on his haunches. The zookeeper awkwardly steps out and faces the indifferent lion. Keeping his eyes on the animal, he walks backward out of view again. Now, three kids stand at the lion enclosure. SOMEONE sets down a wheelbarrow, glances around then cautiously approaches. He watches SOMEONE lounge on some rocks. The kids head off. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS108
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:44,50
SOMEONE stares at the indifferent lion. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS109
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:51,50
A couple passes by. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS110
00:22:50,00 --> 00:22:58,50
The lion while SOMEONE sweeps the sidewalk behind them. He mouths to SOMEONE, What's up? 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS111
00:22:57,00 --> 00:23:02,50
Later, a security guard rides a cart. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS113
00:23:28,00 --> 00:23:34,50
Exiting through a gate, he finds SOMEONE the Lion waiting for him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS114
00:23:39,00 --> 00:23:44,50
Feet and falls on his back. The lion sighs. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS115
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:49,50
SOMEONE lies unconscious under a few swaying elephant toys. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS118
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:18,50
SOMEONE licks his own armpit. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS120
00:26:23,00 --> 00:26:29,50
In his pit, SOMEONE the Gorilla glances up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS121
00:26:27,00 --> 00:26:38,50
He turns away sadly. On another day, patrons walk around the zoo. SOMEONE enters the gorilla enclosure with a bucket and shuts the door behind him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS122
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:42,50
SOMEONE sits with his back to him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS123
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:53,50
The somber gorilla sniffs the air. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS125
00:27:13,00 --> 00:27:18,50
SOMEONE gives no response. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS126
00:27:17,00 --> 00:27:25,50
SOMEONE ambles off with a bucket still in hand. The gorilla shifts his gaze. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS127
00:27:27,00 --> 00:27:37,50
SOMEONE brightens and glances over his shoulder. The gorilla rocks back and forth as the zookeeper sets the bucket down and exits. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS128
00:27:36,00 --> 00:27:42,50
Now, a boy chucks popcorn at the bears from behind a fence. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS130
00:27:52,00 --> 00:27:56,50
The boy lands in the enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS131
00:27:54,00 --> 00:27:59,50
He notices the two brown bears eyeing him hungrily. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS132
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:06,50
He jumps out of his golf cart. He runs halfway up a staircase. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS133
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:21,50
Standing on their hind legs, the bears swap a look. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS134
00:28:22,00 --> 00:28:27,50
He walks the boy through a door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS135
00:28:27,00 --> 00:28:34,50
SOMEONE shuts the door, makes sure no one's watching, then approaches the bears. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS136
00:29:28,00 --> 00:29:31,50
He walks for them. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS137
00:29:36,00 --> 00:29:40,50
SOMEONE lifts his hands. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS138
00:30:13,00 --> 00:30:17,50
SOMEONE walks crotch first. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS139
00:31:04,00 --> 00:31:11,50
SOMEONE notices the students watching him. SOMEONE stands among them. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS140
00:31:09,00 --> 00:31:17,50
He briskly retreats. As the kids disperse, SOMEONE's concerned gaze lingers on her colleague. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS141
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:22,50
In SOMEONE's pit, SOMEONE slides over a bowl of popcorn for the approaching gorilla. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS142
00:31:36,00 --> 00:31:41,50
Shane enters through the metal door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS143
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:45,50
He squints at SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS144
00:32:08,00 --> 00:32:14,50
Shane glances around then points at the gorilla. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS145
00:32:19,00 --> 00:32:24,50
He exits and slides the metal door shut. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS149
00:34:06,00 --> 00:34:10,50
SOMEONE turns to leave. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS150
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:23,50
With the wolf. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS153
00:34:49,00 --> 00:34:53,50
He pees on a pole. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS154
00:35:11,00 --> 00:35:16,50
He faces the pole. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS155
00:35:15,00 --> 00:35:19,50
SOMEONE shrugs. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS156
00:35:20,00 --> 00:35:24,50
Crosses to a tree. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS157
00:35:29,00 --> 00:35:35,50
The wolf crosses to a nearby fence, averting his gaze. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS158
00:35:35,00 --> 00:35:39,50
People walk by behind the fence. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS159
00:35:49,00 --> 00:35:53,50
The women quickly look away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS160
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:56,50
SOMEONE zips up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS161
00:36:03,00 --> 00:36:08,50
The wolf lifts his paw. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS162
00:36:05,00 --> 00:36:10,50
He limps around SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS164
00:36:28,00 --> 00:36:35,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE turn their backs. SOMEONE looks at the wolf. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS165
00:36:33,00 --> 00:36:38,50
He mouths the word sorry. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS167
00:36:40,00 --> 00:36:44,50
Shampoos the wolf's coat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS168
00:36:44,00 --> 00:36:56,50
Now, a jazz trio performs at a fancy restaurant. SOMEONE finishes urinating on a potted plant adorned with mini lights. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS169
00:37:02,00 --> 00:37:06,50
SOMEONE taps him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS170
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:14,50
Joins SOMEONE at the bar. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS172
00:37:25,00 --> 00:37:29,50
As a guy approaches from behind. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS173
00:37:53,00 --> 00:37:57,50
SOMEONE heads off. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS174
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:13,50
SOMEONE turns back to SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS176
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:30,50
He furrows his brow as he considers. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS177
00:38:35,00 --> 00:38:39,50
SOMEONE sulks off. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS178
00:38:37,00 --> 00:38:42,50
Later, at the zoo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS180
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:11,50
Sweeps past SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS181
00:39:30,00 --> 00:39:35,50
SOMEONE looks from the giraffe to SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS182
00:39:35,00 --> 00:39:39,50
He stands. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS184
00:40:04,00 --> 00:40:15,50
He gives a desperate look. Now, SOMEONE pumps his legs as he pedals a recumbent tricycle up a hill. An orange flag waves. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS185
00:41:01,00 --> 00:41:05,50
Semi’s trailer. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS186
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:56,50
Face plants on the cement. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS190
00:43:01,00 --> 00:43:06,50
As she rides off, SOMEONE screeches to a halt. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS191
00:43:10,00 --> 00:43:14,50
He pretends to shoot an arrow. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS192
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:24,50
SOMEONE gives him a baffled frown. SOMEONE mounts his bike then rides away throwing SOMEONE a final glance. Nighttime in the lion enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS194
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:40,50
SOMEONE's eyes narrow. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS195
00:44:27,00 --> 00:44:31,50
SOMEONE turns away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS196
00:44:30,00 --> 00:44:39,50
SOMEONE nods at the lioness and heads off. Now, as SOMEONE eats her lunch, SOMEONE stands at her desk. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS201
00:45:26,00 --> 00:45:31,50
Gorilla stops playing with his swinging ball and turns to find 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS202
00:45:28,00 --> 00:45:33,50
SOMEONE peering inside. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS203
00:45:32,00 --> 00:45:38,50
He enters holding a two-tiered orange cake with lit candles. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS204
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:05,50
Watches with a disbelief. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS205
00:46:13,00 --> 00:46:18,50
He starts to turn away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS206
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:32,50
Nighttime. SOMEONE leads SOMEONE up a staircase which emerges by the mouth of the pit. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS207
00:46:55,00 --> 00:46:59,50
They bump fists. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS208
00:47:04,00 --> 00:47:12,50
SOMEONE heads to a van in a maintenance lot. SOMEONE follows, now wearing a yellow polo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS211
00:47:26,00 --> 00:47:34,50
Lights of downtown skyscrapers. SOMEONE points out the illuminated clock on the Custom House Tower. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS212
00:47:37,00 --> 00:47:43,50
His head out his window and watches the city whizz past. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS213
00:47:44,00 --> 00:47:50,50
SOMEONE bobs his head while SOMEONE holds his hand out. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS214
00:47:54,00 --> 00:47:58,50
With the music, SOMEONE pushes his door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS216
00:48:32,00 --> 00:48:40,50
Grinning, the zookeeper climbs out. He hurries beside SOMEONE who gallops excitedly towards. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS217
00:48:39,00 --> 00:48:44,50
Inside, a waitress approaches their booth. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS218
00:48:45,00 --> 00:48:50,50
Eyes widen at SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS219
00:48:53,00 --> 00:48:57,50
He eyes his polo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS220
00:49:04,00 --> 00:49:11,50
The waitress stares at SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS221
00:49:31,00 --> 00:49:35,50
SOMEONE closes his menu. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS222
00:49:33,00 --> 00:49:38,50
Frowning, the waitress leaves. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS223
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:55,50
Returns from his game of pool and finds SOMEONE slow dancing with a blonde secretary in his arms. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS224
00:50:56,00 --> 00:51:03,50
She smiles dreamily and SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a thumbs up. The zookeeper smiles. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS225
00:51:02,00 --> 00:51:10,50
The two friends lie side by side on the roof of the van and gaze up at the glowing full moon. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS227
00:51:44,00 --> 00:51:51,50
His grin morphs into a frown and he furrows his brow. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS229
00:52:02,00 --> 00:52:08,50
Morning. At the zoo, a frog leaps off a ledge. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS231
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:52,50
Puffs out his throat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS232
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:34,50
He bows his head. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS234
00:53:52,00 --> 00:53:57,50
At the reptile enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS236
00:54:03,00 --> 00:54:08,50
SOMEONE sees an eyeball drawn on Frankie's eye patch. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS237
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:16,50
Venom steps a little closer to SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS238
00:54:17,00 --> 00:54:21,50
SOMEONE glances down. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS239
00:54:27,00 --> 00:54:32,50
The frowning zookeeper hesitates. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS240
00:54:30,00 --> 00:54:39,50
He reaches into Venom's left pants pocket and digs around. SOMEONE shoots his colleague an uncomfortable smile. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS241
00:54:38,00 --> 00:54:45,50
The zookeeper reaches into his right pocket. He pulls out the keys. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS246
00:55:00,00 --> 00:55:05,50
Nodding along to the beat, he looks to an apartment building. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS247
00:55:04,00 --> 00:55:09,50
A woman's shapely legs head down the front steps. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS248
00:55:38,00 --> 00:55:44,50
He shifts his eyes pensively. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS249
00:55:46,00 --> 00:55:51,50
Wedding reception. Acrobats twirl from long swathes of. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS250
00:55:51,00 --> 00:55:55,50
Pictures of the bride and groom. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS251
00:55:53,00 --> 00:55:57,50
SOMEONE some champagne. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS252
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:02,50
He spots SOMEONE with SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS256
00:56:24,00 --> 00:56:29,50
SOMEONE holds out her open palm. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS257
00:56:28,00 --> 00:56:34,50
SOMEONE puts his hand in hers. She places. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS259
00:56:36,00 --> 00:56:41,50
Watches them move to the bar. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS260
00:56:43,00 --> 00:56:49,50
As SOMEONE's eyes meet his, he quickly looks away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS261
00:57:16,00 --> 00:57:20,50
SOMEONE holds a microphone. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS262
00:57:38,00 --> 00:57:45,50
To the DJ. SOMEONE briefly hides her face then dramatically gets up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS263
00:57:47,00 --> 00:57:53,50
SOMEONE mouths along to the lyrics as the couple starts dancing. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS264
00:58:06,00 --> 00:58:11,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE square off from across the dancefloor. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS265
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:43,50
SOMEONE tries with SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS267
00:59:17,00 --> 00:59:22,50
Return to their table. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS268
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:29,50
SOMEONE looks around the ballroom. SOMEONE slouches defeatedly. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS269
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:36,50
She moves off and waves her arms at the DJ on a balcony, then returns to her date. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS270
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:47,50
She takes SOMEONE's arm and leads him to the dancefloor. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS272
00:59:51,00 --> 00:59:59,50
SOMEONE grabs two of the hanging silk drapes. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS273
01:00:04,00 --> 01:00:08,50
And over one of his shoulders. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS274
01:00:08,00 --> 01:00:13,50
Playful smile, she grabs her own pair of drapes. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS276
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:20,50
Then twirls in front of him trying. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS277
01:00:21,00 --> 01:00:25,50
Get SOMEONE's gorgeous. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS278
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:28,50
He starts to sway a little. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS279
01:00:28,00 --> 01:00:33,50
Off her feet and swings. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS280
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:50,50
He were on a swing. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS281
01:01:00,00 --> 01:01:06,50
The other woman at SOMEONE's table turns to watch as well. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS282
01:01:07,00 --> 01:01:12,50
Spins around, but she swings over SOMEONE again. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS283
01:01:23,00 --> 01:01:27,50
As they move apart, we see SOMEONE watching. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS284
01:01:30,00 --> 01:01:35,50
SOMEONE turns to the woman at her table. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS286
01:02:52,00 --> 01:03:00,50
He frowns to himself as the groom walks off. SOMEONE comes over and pulls up a chair. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS287
01:03:07,00 --> 01:03:14,50
SOMEONE blinks for a moment then sets his chunk of ice on the table. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS288
01:03:13,00 --> 01:03:18,50
He gets up from his seat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS289
01:03:30,00 --> 01:03:37,50
SOMEONE stares at him aggressively. SOMEONE purses his lips and puffs out his cheeks. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS290
01:03:37,00 --> 01:03:41,50
And his pants split. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS291
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:47,50
SOMEONE walks off. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS292
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:35,50
SOMEONE hangs up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS293
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:45,50
Her eyes widen as she swallows some food. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS294
01:04:50,00 --> 01:04:57,50
Moving his arms like a robot, he clanks a fork and knife together. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS295
01:04:55,00 --> 01:05:00,50
Stabs the steak off SOMEONE's plate. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS296
01:05:07,00 --> 01:05:13,50
He points across the ballroom then squints. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS297
01:05:20,00 --> 01:05:25,50
Meanwhile, a bartender hands SOMEONE two drinks. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS298
01:05:24,00 --> 01:05:29,50
Spots him and heads over. The two rivals. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS299
01:05:31,00 --> 01:05:37,50
SOMEONE leans on the bar with a cocky smirk. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS300
01:06:32,00 --> 01:06:38,50
He unflinchingly stares down his rival. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS301
01:06:37,00 --> 01:06:44,50
SOMEONE leaves him alone. SOMEONE brings cake. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS302
01:06:43,00 --> 01:06:48,50
He flails his arms. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS303
01:06:45,00 --> 01:06:53,50
As he leaves, SOMEONE puts down the two slices of cake and self-consciously hides her thumb. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS304
01:06:51,00 --> 01:06:55,50
SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS305
01:07:03,00 --> 01:07:09,50
A valet brings them the Mustang and they get in. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS306
01:07:38,00 --> 01:07:43,50
His pretty colleague beams. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS307
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:56,50
Finding SOMEONE outside, he rolls down his window. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS308
01:08:25,00 --> 01:08:34,50
As he rolls his window back up, SOMEONE frowns slightly. Staring straight ahead, SOMEONE remains motionless in his seat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS309
01:08:56,00 --> 01:09:00,50
SOMEONE exits the car. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS310
01:08:58,00 --> 01:09:04,50
She holds the door for Griffins ex who climbs in with him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS311
01:09:15,00 --> 01:09:20,50
SOMEONE looks up at SOMEONE who nods. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS312
01:09:49,00 --> 01:09:54,50
SOMEONE pouts. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS313
01:10:13,00 --> 01:10:17,50
She perks up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS314
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:53,50
At the fashion show, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE towards a man. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS315
01:10:51,00 --> 01:10:56,50
hair, who holds a Chinese crested. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS316
01:11:04,00 --> 01:11:09,50
SOMEONE leans towards her. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS317
01:11:12,00 --> 01:11:17,50
SOMEONE's brow creases. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS318
01:11:50,00 --> 01:11:57,50
Eyeing SOMEONE, he rests his lips on his fists as if thinking. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS319
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:00,50
SOMEONE watches anxiously. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS320
01:12:15,00 --> 01:12:19,50
They ride in the back of a limo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS321
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:32,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS323
01:12:51,00 --> 01:12:57,50
As SOMEONE stares with crestfallen eyes, SOMEONE leans. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS324
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:01,50
He gives a dazed look. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS325
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:06,50
Blinking, he turns away from her. The corner of his mouth lifts into an. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS327
01:13:33,00 --> 01:13:36,50
Tosses Glen the keys. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS328
01:13:43,00 --> 01:13:49,50
Holsters his invisible guns. As a middle-aged man exams a sports car. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS329
01:13:47,00 --> 01:13:53,50
Keeper stares with predatory eyes. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS330
01:13:52,00 --> 01:13:56,50
And exchange a glance. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS331
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:09,50
SOMEONE faces the customer. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS332
01:14:15,00 --> 01:14:25,50
SOMEONE hits his head on the car's raised scissor door as he tries to climb inside. He hits his rear on the horn as he attempts to back into the seat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS333
01:14:22,00 --> 01:14:27,50
Then finally slides his body. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS334
01:14:43,00 --> 01:14:50,50
Now, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE standing outside the new eagle enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS335
01:14:57,00 --> 01:15:02,50
She looks in a cage. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS336
01:15:04,00 --> 01:15:10,50
An eagle flies out and perches beside another eagle. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS338
01:15:22,00 --> 01:15:28,50
Frowning, SOMEONE shifts her gaze to the eagles. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS339
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:39,50
She scowls at him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS340
01:16:18,00 --> 01:16:22,50
She meets his gaze. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS341
01:16:24,00 --> 01:16:34,50
Bowing his head, SOMEONE shakes it. As SOMEONE watches expectantly, he lifts his eyes to hers and nods. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS342
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:38,50
Her shoulders sag and she gives a disappointed look. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS343
01:16:37,00 --> 01:16:56,50
With a resigned smile, she leans against the railing around the eagle enclosure's glass observation wall and stares out at the birds. SOMEONE blinks at her, his lips parted in a discouraged expression, then glances at the eagles. As he walks off, SOMEONE watches with heartbroken eyes. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS344
01:16:54,00 --> 01:17:04,50
Later, SOMEONE slides open the door to SOMEONE's enclosure and peers inside. He enters with a box of popcorn in one hand. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS345
01:17:07,00 --> 01:17:15,50
With his back to the former zookeeper, SOMEONE sits facing the enclosure's far wall. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS346
01:17:32,00 --> 01:17:38,50
SOMEONE checks his phone's caller ID. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS347
01:17:54,00 --> 01:18:14,50
SOMEONE drops his pained gaze then returns it to SOMEONE who looks away. Shrugging his hands, the former zookeeper opens his mouth to speak then licks his lips and takes a step toward the door. He shoots the gorilla a final glance then leaves. Stepping into the corridor, he slides the door closed and starts. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS349
01:18:19,00 --> 01:18:24,50
He strides over to him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS350
01:18:31,00 --> 01:18:35,50
Shane shifts his weight. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS351
01:18:44,00 --> 01:18:53,50
Under SOMEONE's firm gaze, Shane swallows hard then nods. He returns a can of pepper spray to its holder on a. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS353
01:19:07,00 --> 01:19:21,50
Pushing the Ferrari's passenger seat forward, he indicates the trunk. His gray-haired customer gives an uncertain look. SOMEONE's smirk fades as a bus pauses on the street outside. It bears an. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS354
01:19:19,00 --> 01:19:24,50
which reads, The eagles have landed. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS355
01:19:22,00 --> 01:19:27,50
Now, at the zoo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS357
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:12,50
Now, Venom holds two lizards as he approaches SOMEONE who stares into SOMEONE's pit. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS358
01:20:26,00 --> 01:20:31,50
SOMEONE overhears and frowns. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS359
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:54,50
Venom gazes at her. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS360
01:20:51,00 --> 01:21:00,50
Closing his eyes, he puckers his lips and leans toward her. As he draws closer, he opens his mouth. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS361
01:21:15,00 --> 01:21:22,50
Later, SOMEONE enters a luxury condo and finds SOMEONE doing yoga. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS362
01:21:34,00 --> 01:21:39,50
She beams at three balls in a row. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS363
01:21:45,00 --> 01:21:49,50
SOMEONE sits on the middle ball. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS367
01:22:31,00 --> 01:22:42,50
SOMEONE faces a floor-to-ceiling window and gazes out at the city. With a dispirited look, he trudges out of the living room. Now. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS368
01:22:40,00 --> 01:22:45,50
Door to SOMEONE's enclosure unlocks and the gorilla.

Hopeful eyes. He watches as it slides open and.

01:22:48,00 --> 01:22:55,50
Nail tipped stick. SOMEONE turns his back to the goateed zookeeper. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS371
01:22:54,00 --> 01:23:00,50
Stepping closer, Shane rests his stick on his shoulder. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS372
01:22:58,00 --> 01:23:04,50
He reaches into a pants pocket and withdraws an apple. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS373
01:23:03,00 --> 01:23:11,50
He takes a bite then hurls it against the far wall. Apple chunks explode over SOMEONE's head. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS374
01:23:09,00 --> 01:23:15,50
Pepper spray. At the dealership, a salesman talks to his colleague. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS375
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:31,50
The salesman's head swivel toward the customer. SOMEONE and Nimer exchange a look then both. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS376
01:23:35,00 --> 01:23:41,50
He heads to the door as Nimer greets the high roller. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS377
01:23:39,00 --> 01:23:44,50
SOMEONE stands by the door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS379
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:04,50
She opens a velvet box. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS380
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:09,50
Dropping to one knee, SOMEONE falters then straightens. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS381
01:24:43,00 --> 01:24:49,50
As SOMEONE stares, a mariachi band enters. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS382
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:14,50
As she leaves the dealership, the band follows. Now SOMEONE sits in his enclosure with his back to the door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS383
01:25:14,00 --> 01:25:19,50
He sniffs the air, his nostrils twitching. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS384
01:25:37,00 --> 01:25:46,50
Turning, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE back in a zookeeper’s uniform. He smiles and SOMEONE gives a nod. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS385
01:25:54,00 --> 01:25:59,50
The crow lands on the pit wall. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS386
01:26:38,00 --> 01:26:42,50
SOMEONE runs off. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS387
01:27:08,00 --> 01:27:12,50
SOMEONE takes flight. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS388
01:27:11,00 --> 01:27:17,50
In a parking lot, SOMEONE the Gorilla crosses to a van and open.

Later, it cruises down a residential street. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS395
01:28:17,00 --> 01:28:21,50
The van stops short. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS396
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:38,50
Right past her, he heads upstairs and. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS397
01:28:37,00 --> 01:28:42,50
Shane gets up from a computer in his underwear. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS398
01:28:41,00 --> 01:28:47,50
Wall which crumbles around him. SOMEONE marches out. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS400
01:28:55,00 --> 01:28:59,50
Steering wheel turning sharply around a bend. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS401
01:28:58,00 --> 01:29:03,50
The road at the scene of an accident. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS402
01:29:11,00 --> 01:29:17,50
Apartment buildings. It dead ends in a 15 foot wall. The van. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS403
01:29:15,00 --> 01:29:22,50
To a stop and SOMEONE clambers out on all fours. He follows SOMEONE over to the wall. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS404
01:29:24,00 --> 01:29:30,50
The zookeeper and the gorilla swap a look. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS405
01:29:30,00 --> 01:29:34,50
Now, SOMEONE flies over the wall. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS406
01:29:36,00 --> 01:29:41,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE steps out of her apartment. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS408
01:29:47,00 --> 01:29:51,50
It rounds a corner. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS409
01:29:49,00 --> 01:29:53,50
As it drives away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS410
01:30:00,00 --> 01:30:06,50
SOMEONE holds a kayak over his head. He toss. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS411

As the taxi drives alongside the river, SOMEONE and SOMEONE row after it. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS413
01:30:34,00 --> 01:30:39,50
Support beams to find the kayak arriving below.

Lifts the portly zookeeper up with one arm. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS415
01:30:44,00 --> 01:30:49,50
They move for the support beam. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS416
01:30:53,00 --> 01:31:03,50
He clings to SOMEONE's back as the gorilla climbs the beam which angles nearly 45 degrees outward. SOMEONE glances around. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS418
01:31:17,00 --> 01:31:21,50
SOMEONE reaches back and pulls. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS419

Of a spotlight and rises to his feet with the zoo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS420
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:30,50
SOMEONE keeps climbing. Our view retracts. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS421
01:31:28,00 --> 01:31:34,50
Bridge as they continue up the beam which now slants. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS422
01:31:44,00 --> 01:31:48,50
Taxi inches along. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS423
01:31:48,00 --> 01:31:53,50
The gorilla dangles above it. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS424
01:32:02,00 --> 01:32:10,50
To the road. SOMEONE gasps as he pulls himself up on the hood of her cab. She gets out. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS425
01:33:10,00 --> 01:33:19,50
She kisses SOMEONE then wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him again. Our view circles the embracing couple. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS426
01:33:18,00 --> 01:33:21,50
In their cars. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS427
01:33:25,00 --> 01:33:29,50
Gorilla then glances upward. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS429
01:33:37,00 --> 01:33:42,50
Words appear, Six months later.

View of the entire zoo and the. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS431

SOMEONE steps up beside him. SOMEONE blinks emotionally then. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS432
01:33:50,00 --> 01:33:55,50
Standing on a tall mound of boulders. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS433
01:33:53,00 --> 01:33:57,50
Gentle waterfall. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS434

Smile with SOMEONE.

01:34:03,00 --> 01:34:08,50
SOMEONE wraps his arm around him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS437
01:34:13,00 --> 01:34:19,50
A small screen shows the animals singing along with the music. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS31
00:03:05,00 --> 00:03:11,50
Moving to the door, she looks at the head coach and grins. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS32
00:03:11,00 --> 00:03:16,50
She steps out to meet SOMEONE in the hall. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS33
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:23,50
The bitter assistant coach shares a warm hug with her player. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS34
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:26,50
Now as we rove over a river toward a city, words appear. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS35
00:03:23,00 --> 00:03:28,50
Arlington, Virginia a few days later.

Teammates throw balls to SOMEONE who drops them in a bucket beside third base.

00:03:36,00 --> 00:03:41,50
A cellphone rings inside an open duffel bag. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS39
00:03:42,00 --> 00:03:47,50
As SOMEONE looks over, a ball hits her in the face. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS40
00:03:51,00 --> 00:03:56,50
Her mouth bloodied, she answers the phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS41
00:04:26,00 --> 00:04:32,50
A woman in a skirt suit barges into SOMEONE's office with a letter. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS42
00:04:39,00 --> 00:04:43,50
He accepts the letter. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS43
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:21,50
In the office, the boyish businessman opens his letter to find a subpoena for a wire fraud case which reads, United States of America v. SOMEONE Madison.

00:05:21,00 --> 00:05:25,50

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS51
00:07:00,00 --> 00:07:04,50
She turns back.

She nods. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS56
00:07:50,00 --> 00:07:58,50
The gray haired doorman glances at SOMEONE, then takes three steps back to patiently stand beside him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS57
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:05,50
SOMEONE glances at each of them, then throws up her arms and starts inside. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS58
00:08:08,00 --> 00:08:12,50
She punches his stomach. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS59
00:08:11,00 --> 00:08:19,50
The next morning, in a well-furnished bedroom with an adjoining balcony, SOMEONE lies alone in bed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS60
00:08:19,00 --> 00:08:26,50
She sits up and peers across the room, then grabs her slip from a nightstand. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS61
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:40,50
He sets two frothy, white blender drinks on a ledge, opens a window, and shakes his head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS62
00:08:42,00 --> 00:08:46,50
He hops on the bed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS63
00:09:12,00 --> 00:09:21,50
He hands SOMEONE one of the drinks. She eyes its garnishment of fruit and a blue plastic star, then takes a sip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS64
00:09:40,00 --> 00:09:43,50
She sets it down. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS65
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:46,50
She grabs her dress and steps out. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS66
00:09:49,00 --> 00:09:56,50
SOMEONE looks around the huge bathroom, which leads to a massive walk-in closet. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS67
00:09:59,00 --> 00:10:06,50
She opens the drawer and finds it filled with unopened toothbrushes of every color and pattern.

00:10:03,00 --> 00:10:07,50
SOMEONE enters. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS69
00:10:04,00 --> 00:10:11,50
SOMEONE takes a brush, then puts her bright red dress on over her matching slip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS70
00:10:15,00 --> 00:10:21,50
He opens a cabinet filled with women's pink sweat suits. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS71
00:10:21,00 --> 00:10:26,50
Size stickers SOMEONE a stack of sweatshirts. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS72
00:10:38,00 --> 00:10:41,50
She heads out. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS73
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:22,50
He watches her head out the front door. She starts to pull it shut behind her, then stops and reenters the apartment. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS74
00:11:24,00 --> 00:11:31,50
She storms back down the hallway and returns to the bedroom where SOMEONE sits on his bed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS75
00:11:55,00 --> 00:11:59,50
He beams. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS76
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:35,50
With a smile, she leans in. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS77
00:12:38,00 --> 00:12:45,50
Now SOMEONE strolls down a sidewalk in her rumpled red dress, passing another pedestrian. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS78
00:12:43,00 --> 00:12:48,50
A breeze rustles the green leaves of a bush nearby. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS79
00:12:45,00 --> 00:12:54,50
SOMEONE crosses a street, then reaches into her purse as she approaches the front door of a columned apartment building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS80
00:12:51,00 --> 00:12:56,50
Later inside, she sits at a laptop. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS81
00:12:54,00 --> 00:13:01,50
A USA softball website reads, Announcement of 2011 Team USA. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS82
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:06,50
SOMEONE clicks on the link and a notice appears, Selection of next year's team delayed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS83
00:13:04,00 --> 00:13:09,50
SOMEONE deflates, then leaves the laptop. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS84
00:13:06,00 --> 00:13:11,50
Now pedestrians walk past an office building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS85
00:13:12,00 --> 00:13:19,50
Inside, SOMEONE finds a bespectacled man drying his hands in a men's room. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS86
00:13:17,00 --> 00:13:21,50
He hands him the subpoena. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS87
00:13:20,00 --> 00:13:26,50
The bespectacled man finishes drying a hand, then reads. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS88
00:13:43,00 --> 00:13:47,50
The man's eyes widen. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS89
00:13:52,00 --> 00:13:57,50
He braces himself and takes a breath. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS90
00:13:54,00 --> 00:13:58,50
In SOMEONE's office. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS91
00:13:57,00 --> 00:14:03,50
A bespectacled man with thinning gray hair kisses him on the cheek. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS92
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:09,50
SOMEONE hands him the subpoena. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS93
00:14:06,00 --> 00:14:12,50
The lawyer peers closely over his shoulder to read along. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS94
00:14:37,00 --> 00:14:42,50
SOMEONE picks up his phone receiver and dials. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS95
00:14:44,00 --> 00:14:49,50
A pregnant, auburn haired woman enters. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS97
00:16:44,00 --> 00:16:50,50
SOMEONE furiously leaps up to punch him from behind, but SOMEONE stops her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS98
00:17:20,00 --> 00:17:25,50
Ron sits with SOMEONE and dictates to her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS99
00:17:36,00 --> 00:17:44,50
As SOMEONE exits the office, SOMEONE notes his dejected expression. Outside, SOMEONE crosses the street. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS100
00:17:42,00 --> 00:17:47,50
He stops and presses a hand to his forehead. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS102
00:17:53,00 --> 00:17:59,50
Glancing out a window, Ron spots SOMEONE sulking across the street. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS103
00:17:57,00 --> 00:18:04,50
Rising from the table, he faces the window and takes out his cell. He makes a call. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS104
00:18:04,00 --> 00:18:11,50
Outside, SOMEONE fishes his phone from his pocket and answers. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS105
00:18:35,00 --> 00:18:40,50
SOMEONE stares up at the fourth floor office window. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS106
00:18:48,00 --> 00:18:54,50
Ron hangs up, leaving SOMEONE staring up at him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS107
00:18:51,00 --> 00:18:56,50
Later in an apartment, SOMEONE makes a call. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS108
00:19:05,00 --> 00:19:10,50
His girlfriend eyes him from behind a desk. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS109
00:19:18,00 --> 00:19:21,50
He hangs up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS111
00:19:35,00 --> 00:19:38,50
She rises. She moves to SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS112
00:19:37,00 --> 00:19:44,50
She moves to SOMEONE and squats in front of him, resting her hands on his knees. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS113
00:19:46,00 --> 00:19:50,50
She briefly rubs his legs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS114
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:28,50
Gaping, SOMEONE leaves. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS115
00:20:25,00 --> 00:20:33,50
Later, he grills a steak on a patio balcony, his tie discarded and his shirt untucked. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS116
00:20:30,00 --> 00:20:38,50
He sprinkles seasoning on the meat, his hand jerking the container more and more aggressively as he loses composure. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS117
00:20:38,00 --> 00:20:46,50
Stabbing a fork into the steak, he flips it repeatedly, then suddenly hurls it off the balcony. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS118
00:20:46,00 --> 00:20:53,50
Now inside, he pours vodka into a shot glass and eyeballs it.

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS120
00:20:56,00 --> 00:21:04,50
He adds a spoonful of horseradish, some Worcestershire sauce and tomato juice, then shakes it all up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS121
00:21:03,00 --> 00:21:10,50
With a celery stalk, he stirs his glass of Bloody Mary, then takes a sip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS122
00:21:09,00 --> 00:21:15,50
Later, SOMEONE fills his empty glass with more Bloody SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS123
00:21:13,00 --> 00:21:20,50
The image dissolves to him clumsily refilling the glass with straight vodka. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS124
00:21:19,00 --> 00:21:23,50
Now he points a remote control. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS125
00:21:32,00 --> 00:21:36,50
He sings into a lamp like a microphone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS126
00:21:54,00 --> 00:21:58,50
He grabs another drink. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS127
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:10,50
Now in the bathroom, SOMEONE urinates. He grabs his phone with his free hand. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS128
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:26,50
SOMEONE muffles his phone inside a towel. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS129
00:22:24,00 --> 00:22:29,50
Holding it away from the toilet, he flushes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS130
00:22:27,00 --> 00:22:31,50
He rinses his hand. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS131
00:22:41,00 --> 00:22:46,50
She lifts her shirt and pats her enormous belly. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS132
00:22:49,00 --> 00:22:55,50
Heading down a staircase, SOMEONE trips and slides to the bottom on his back. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS133
00:22:56,00 --> 00:23:01,50
With a grin, he rises, unharmed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS134
00:23:40,00 --> 00:23:46,50
Hanging her head, SOMEONE squeezes her eyes shut. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS135
00:23:43,00 --> 00:23:47,50
They tear up as she opens them. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS136
00:24:28,00 --> 00:24:32,50
With a furrowed brow, SOMEONE hangs up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS137
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:37,50
He briefly presses his fingers to his forehead, then leans back in his chair. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS138
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:41,50
Rising, he straightens his T-shirt as he trudges out of his living room. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS139
00:24:38,00 --> 00:24:44,50
He pauses, opens his phone, and makes a call. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS140
00:24:41,00 --> 00:24:46,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE rides on a bus. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS141
00:24:46,00 --> 00:24:51,50
She pulls her phone from her bag and answers. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS142
00:24:56,00 --> 00:25:00,50
SOMEONE frowns uncertainly. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS143
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:29,50
SOMEONE leans on a wall and slips. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS144
00:25:44,00 --> 00:25:49,50
He lowers his phone and folds it shut. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS145
00:25:46,00 --> 00:25:53,50
The next morning, two women stroll across the street in front of SOMEONE's apartment building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS146
00:25:50,00 --> 00:25:55,50
Inside, she lies asleep in bed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS147
00:25:57,00 --> 00:26:02,50
She bolts awake and glances around. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS148
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:08,50
As she throws back her covers, her legs get tangled in the sheets and she wrestles them off. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS149
00:26:05,00 --> 00:26:10,50
She strides to a table and grabs her phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS150
00:26:07,00 --> 00:26:13,50
Its display reads, Missed call Coach SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS151
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:16,50
Frowning, SOMEONE runs a hand through her mussed hair. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS152
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:22,50
She turns to her computer, which displays the softball team website, and clicks on the link for the announcement of the 2011 team. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS153
00:26:20,00 --> 00:26:24,50
A window appears. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS154
00:26:21,00 --> 00:26:25,50
Click to see next year's lineup. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS155
00:26:27,00 --> 00:26:35,50
SOMEONE shifts her gaze to her phone, then picks it up and reads a text message from Riva, I'm coming over. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS156
00:26:34,00 --> 00:26:41,50
Setting the phone back down, she sits at her laptop and types frantically. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS157
00:26:39,00 --> 00:26:45,50
She scrolls through the team lineup, but doesn't find her name. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS158
00:26:42,00 --> 00:26:48,50
A blue asterisk blinks on the roster, indicating a new player. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS159
00:26:45,00 --> 00:26:51,50
The position reads, Cam Austin, second base. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS160
00:26:48,00 --> 00:26:52,50
SOMEONE drops her head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS161
00:26:51,00 --> 00:26:56,50
Pressing her lips together, she closes her eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS162
00:26:54,00 --> 00:27:00,50
She lifts her gaze back to the laptop and stares at it. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS163
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:02,50
Her chest heaving then closes her eyes again. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS164
00:27:02,00 --> 00:27:09,50
She reopens them and stares at the blue asterisk, blinking beside her replacement's name. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS167
00:27:10,00 --> 00:27:20,50
Now in her bathroom. SOMEONE grabs her electric toothbrush. The mirror is covered in inspirational quotes written on sticky notes, including, Obstacles are what you see when you lose sight of your goal. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS168
00:27:18,00 --> 00:27:23,50
Blinking rapidly, SOMEONE starts to brush her teeth. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS169
00:27:24,00 --> 00:27:32,50
As her gaze scans the brightly colored notes, she stops brushing and closes her lips around her toothbrush. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS170
00:27:31,00 --> 00:27:36,50
With sad eyes, she resumes brushing. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS171
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:41,50
She closes her eyes and tears slide down her cheeks. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS172
00:27:38,00 --> 00:27:44,50
As her face crumples, she lowers her toothbrush from her mouth. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS173
00:27:41,00 --> 00:27:46,50
Her hand dropping heavily on the counter. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS174
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:48,50
Her mouth trembles. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS175
00:27:45,00 --> 00:27:50,50
A froth of toothpaste clinging to her lower lip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS176
00:27:49,00 --> 00:27:56,50
She reads two quotes; Courage is mastery of fear, not absence of fear. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS177
00:27:53,00 --> 00:27:58,50
Don't judge anybody before you check yourself out. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS178
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:01,50
You're lucky when it's your fault, because you can correct the situation. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS180
00:28:05,00 --> 00:28:09,50
Her expression hardens. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS181
00:28:10,00 --> 00:28:16,50
She leans over the sink. Eyeing her reflection, she wipes her mouth, then heads off. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS182
00:28:16,00 --> 00:28:21,50
Now SOMEONE leaves his building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS183
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:07,50
SOMEONE sprints away. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS184
00:29:05,00 --> 00:29:10,50
In his suit and dress shoes. SOMEONE blinks and stares. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS185
00:29:07,00 --> 00:29:13,50
Now SOMEONE dons a skirt as her teammates visit. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS186
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:35,50
She heads for the door. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS187
00:30:19,00 --> 00:30:24,50
Now SOMEONE marches down a city street. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS188
00:30:22,00 --> 00:30:30,50
Pausing at a corner, she wipes a tear, ruefully checks her fingers for runny makeup and rolls her eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS189
00:30:29,00 --> 00:30:35,50
Now at an elegant restaurant, she approaches a well-dressed Maître d'. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS190
00:30:40,00 --> 00:30:47,50
The Maître d' leads her onto a balcony and gestures down toward a solitary figure at a table. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS191
00:30:48,00 --> 00:30:53,50
SOMEONE sits slumped, his head in his hands. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS192
00:30:54,00 --> 00:30:58,50
The grinning Maître d' leads on. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS193
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:03,50
He obligingly excuses himself. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS194
00:31:00,00 --> 00:31:06,50
Heading along the balcony, SOMEONE regards her date uncertainly. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS195
00:31:03,00 --> 00:31:08,50
Now she arrives at his table. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS196
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:10,50
He looks up pitiably. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS197
00:31:09,00 --> 00:31:13,50
He springs to his feet. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS198
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:19,50
SOMEONE slips into the high-backed booth. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS199
00:31:20,00 --> 00:31:25,50
SOMEONE shrugs her brow and frowns. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS200
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:33,50
SOMEONE's eyes narrow. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS201
00:31:52,00 --> 00:31:57,50
SOMEONE picks up her menu and SOMEONE nods. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS202
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:18,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes, then studies her menu. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS203
00:33:04,00 --> 00:33:08,50
SOMEONE stares helplessly at her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS204
00:33:32,00 --> 00:33:37,50
Smiling, SOMEONE stares at her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS205
00:33:34,00 --> 00:33:40,50
His eyes twinkle and he gives a stunned shake of the head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS206
00:33:37,00 --> 00:33:43,50
He amiably shuts his mouth and faces his menu. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS207
00:33:40,00 --> 00:33:47,50
SOMEONE fidgets her fingers, allows a small half-smile, and nods. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS208
00:33:44,00 --> 00:33:49,50
Later, they dine on spaghetti and meatballs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS209
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:52,50
SOMEONE cuts a chunk of tomato and eats it. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS210
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:54,50
SOMEONE sneaks glances at her as he chews. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS211
00:33:52,00 --> 00:33:58,50
His date shifts her worried gaze, occasionally eyeing him impassively. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS212
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:01,50
Her features contorting in a pensive frown. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS213
00:33:59,00 --> 00:34:04,50
SOMEONE stops eating and leans back in her seat. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS214
00:34:10,00 --> 00:34:16,50
Her lips part and her stubborn chin juts forward. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS215
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:18,50
SOMEONE studies her intently. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS216
00:34:16,00 --> 00:34:20,50
His brow lifts and he stops chewing. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS217
00:34:18,00 --> 00:34:22,50
Catching him staring, SOMEONE gives a nervous half-smile and looks down. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS219
00:34:22,00 --> 00:34:27,50
SOMEONE's lips curl into a dreamy-eyed smile. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS221
00:34:26,00 --> 00:34:33,50
He opens the restaurant door for SOMEONE and follows her out with a goofy grin. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS222
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:40,50
He shrugs and beams at her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS223
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:44,50
SOMEONE creases her lips, sizing him up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS224
00:34:43,00 --> 00:34:48,50
SOMEONE watches her go with his boyish grin. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS225
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:52,50
Now SOMEONE uses his cellphone as he leaves his building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS226
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:01,50
In a bar, SOMEONE talks on the phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS227
00:35:08,00 --> 00:35:13,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, the doorman. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS228
00:35:14,00 --> 00:35:20,50
The doorman chuckles, points, and steps away. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS229
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:37,50
Now SOMEONE plods up a flight of stairs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS230
00:35:34,00 --> 00:35:47,50
Entering her apartment, she finds a bouquet of flowers with an attached construction paper card, reading, We love you, Smalls. Dozens of other notes surround the gift, and SOMEONE sits behind the display. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS231
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:14,50
Now in SOMEONE's apartment. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS232
00:36:14,00 --> 00:36:18,50
He crosses to the door. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS233
00:36:27,00 --> 00:36:33,50
SOMEONE sulks into the living room. She halts abruptly and looks around. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS234
00:37:00,00 --> 00:37:04,50
He leads her to a couch. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS235
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:11,50
As she sits, he lies down and puts his head in her lap. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS236
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:14,50
SOMEONE squirms an arm out from under his shoulder and sets her bag on the floor. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS237
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:26,50
Daytime. SOMEONE ushers SOMEONE through a dignified office building's thriving lobby. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS238
00:37:23,00 --> 00:37:30,50
Reaching a reception desk, they peer at a vast wall mounted directory. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS239
00:37:31,00 --> 00:37:37,50
SOMEONE brushes off his son's suit jacket as he guides him along. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS240
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:45,50
Now they sit side-by-side on a waiting room couch, both resting their hands on their parted knees and drumming their fingers. Later, SOMEONE faces a bearded man. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS241
00:38:05,00 --> 00:38:10,50
SOMEONE's head droops forward and he bites his upper lip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS242
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:19,50
Now SOMEONE arrives in a tasteful office where a man with a closely trimmed beard waits at a desk. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS243
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:34,50
He gestures to a SOMEONE to sit on chair or ottoman. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS245
00:38:32,00 --> 00:38:37,50
SOMEONE perches on the ottoman. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS246
00:38:34,00 --> 00:38:38,50
As he takes a seat facing her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS247
00:38:37,00 --> 00:38:42,50
The kind-faced man crosses his legs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS248
00:38:52,00 --> 00:38:57,50
The psychiatrist patiently lifts his chin. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS249
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:50,50
Narrowing her eyes, SOMEONE gives an appreciative nod and starts to leave. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS250
00:39:48,00 --> 00:39:52,50
She halts in the doorway and turns around. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS251
00:40:13,00 --> 00:40:18,50
SOMEONE leaves then reappears in his doorway. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS253
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:25,50
As rain pours, party guests in summery clothes crowd a home. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS254
00:40:22,00 --> 00:40:29,50
SOMEONE gets food at a buffet while SOMEONE waits on a covered terrace. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS255
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:34,50
Seeing her through a window he notices her watching the man beside him fondling a woman's breast. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS256
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:38,50
SOMEONE pulls the man's hand down and directs their attention to SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS257
00:40:35,00 --> 00:40:41,50
The woman scowls and puts her date's hand back on her breast. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS258
00:40:38,00 --> 00:40:43,50
SOMEONE brings SOMEONE food. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS259
00:41:09,00 --> 00:41:14,50
SOMEONE glances toward the partiers inside. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS260
00:41:29,00 --> 00:41:35,50
SOMEONE shifts in his seat and gives a sheepishly obliging shrug. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS261
00:42:09,00 --> 00:42:14,50
SOMEONE gives a meek, pleased smile. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS262
00:42:13,00 --> 00:42:20,50
Now a bird's eye view shows an umbrella only half sheltering SOMEONE's plate of BBQ. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS263
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:22,50
He and SOMEONE share the umbrella. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS264
00:42:19,00 --> 00:42:25,50
SOMEONE sadly throws the plate in a trash bin. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS265
00:42:23,00 --> 00:42:27,50
Later at his place. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS266
00:42:53,00 --> 00:42:58,50
He grins and SOMEONE gives him an irritated look. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS267
00:43:04,00 --> 00:43:09,50
Standing behind her he wraps his arms around her waist. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS268
00:43:20,00 --> 00:43:23,50
SOMEONE nods. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS269
00:43:26,00 --> 00:43:30,50
He pours Cheerios. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS270
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:41,50
He adds Life cereal to their bowls 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS271
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:53,50
SOMEONE gives him a nod. SOMEONE pours blueberries over their cereal. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS272
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:21,50
SOMEONE gives her a bowl. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS273
00:44:37,00 --> 00:44:45,50
With a mouthful of cereal, SOMEONE shifts her thoughtful eyes. She gives SOMEONE an expectant look. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS274
00:44:58,00 --> 00:45:02,50
SOMEONE shakes his head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS275
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:27,50
He slaps her shoulder. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS276
00:45:25,00 --> 00:45:31,50
As he starts to eat his cereal, SOMEONE gives him an appreciative look. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS277
00:45:31,00 --> 00:45:36,50
SOMEONE stops eating and looks over with wide eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS278
00:45:35,00 --> 00:45:41,50
He gives a disturbed look and she playfully punches his arm. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS279
00:45:40,00 --> 00:45:48,50
Now our view tilts up from the lobby doors past the engraved entablature just below the second story. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS280
00:45:46,00 --> 00:45:49,50
Bowlen building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS281
00:45:48,00 --> 00:45:53,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie with their heads at the foot of his bed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS282
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:05,50
SOMEONE claps and the lights turn on. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS283
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:25,50
She points at him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS284
00:46:41,00 --> 00:46:48,50
As he leans over her, she punches his shoulder twice. The lights turn off. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS285
00:46:54,00 --> 00:47:01,50
On another day, SOMEONE sits on the bench in the National's bullpen smiling to himself. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS286
00:47:01,00 --> 00:47:06,50
He stares off dreamily. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS287
00:47:04,00 --> 00:47:09,50
He blinks himself out of his reverie. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS288
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:11,50
An opposing player rounds third toward home plate. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS289
00:47:09,00 --> 00:47:15,50
A National's outfielder makes an amazing catch, right over the wall of the bullpen. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS290
00:47:17,00 --> 00:47:22,50
His teammates swivel their heads toward him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS291
00:47:23,00 --> 00:47:28,50
Shrugging his hands a ball player rises. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS292
00:47:32,00 --> 00:47:36,50
Starting his warm-up he catches a ball. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS293
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:44,50
SOMEONE catches the ball again, then leans toward him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS294
00:47:46,00 --> 00:47:50,50
SOMEONE's shoulders heave. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS295
00:47:52,00 --> 00:47:59,50
Later in the National's training room, SOMEONE holds his phone to his ear as he runs in a pool treadmill. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS296
00:47:58,00 --> 00:48:04,50
In her apartment, SOMEONE removes the bag from the trashcan. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS297
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:07,50
She lets the can fall as she goes to the phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS298
00:48:13,00 --> 00:48:17,50
SOMEONE's jaw drops. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS299
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:38,50
Hanging up, SOMEONE glances around, then returns her attention to the trash bag. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS300
00:48:40,00 --> 00:48:44,50
Grinning she flips open her phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS301
00:48:47,00 --> 00:48:51,50
A trainer brings him ice. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS302
00:49:28,00 --> 00:49:33,50
SOMEONE's mouth lifts into a crooked SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS303
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:47,50
SOMEONE shifts her eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS304
00:50:15,00 --> 00:50:20,50
With a thoughtful look, SOMEONE hangs up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS305
00:50:17,00 --> 00:50:22,50
Now she packs a duffel bag in her room. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS306
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:23,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS307
00:50:46,00 --> 00:50:52,50
The assistant coach rises from the arm of a sofa and hugs her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS308
00:51:03,00 --> 00:51:07,50
SOMEONE answers his front door. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS309
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:13,50
She indicates a large stack of bags and suitcases. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS310
00:51:12,00 --> 00:51:18,50
In his closet, SOMEONE opens a drawer that's only one third empty. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS311
00:51:26,00 --> 00:51:31,50
She nods and they share a smile. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS312
00:51:28,00 --> 00:51:33,50
Glancing back at the drawer she shrugs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS313
00:51:31,00 --> 00:51:35,50
Now at an apartment above a bakery. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS314
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:43,50
SOMEONE rises from a desk at a bay window. Boxes and other packed items line his small living room and hallway. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS315
00:51:40,00 --> 00:51:44,50
He opens the door. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS316
00:51:47,00 --> 00:51:51,50
SOMEONE carries in a grocery bag. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS317
00:52:11,00 --> 00:52:16,50
SOMEONE loads the fridge. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS318
00:52:17,00 --> 00:52:22,50
SOMEONE waddles to an armchair and sinks down in it. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS319
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:38,50
She stands. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS320
00:53:49,00 --> 00:53:56,50
Standing in front of him, SOMEONE bites her lip and eyes him skeptically. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS321
00:53:54,00 --> 00:53:59,50
She takes a few steps away and gives him a sidelong look. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS322
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:03,50
With her thoughtful gaze still locked on his face 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS323
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:05,50
she cocks her heads and studies him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS324
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:11,50
She sets her hands on her hips. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS325
00:54:25,00 --> 00:54:31,50
She juts out her jaw, then curls her lips together. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS326
00:54:28,00 --> 00:54:33,50
SOMEONE stands ready to exit his apartment. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS327
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:38,50
She heads to the kitchen. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS329
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:47,50
SOMEONE approaches the Bowlen Building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS330
00:54:44,00 --> 00:54:49,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE makes a call from the desk in his study. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS331
00:54:55,00 --> 00:54:59,50
SOMEONE stops in the lobby. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS332
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:28,50
SOMEONE closes his eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS333
00:55:26,00 --> 00:55:34,50
He shuts his phone then letting his upper body go limp, slams his head onto a decorative table and holds it there. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS334
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:39,50
The doorman and a concierge stare at him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS335
00:55:36,00 --> 00:55:41,50
Now SOMEONE trudges into an elevator. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS336
00:55:38,00 --> 00:55:44,50
As he rubs his forehead SOMEONE rushes through the open doors. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS337
00:55:44,00 --> 00:55:51,50
With a bag of groceries slung over her shoulder, she stands beside him as he rubs his face. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS338
00:55:49,00 --> 00:55:54,50
His hand descends to his mouth, pulling down his lower lip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS339
00:55:52,00 --> 00:55:56,50
SOMEONE glances over. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS340
00:55:55,00 --> 00:56:00,50
He looks at her, then quickly releases his lip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS341
00:56:13,00 --> 00:56:20,50
Later, SOMEONE follows SOMEONE into SOMEONE's apartment, carrying the bag of groceries. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS342
00:56:18,00 --> 00:56:23,50
She takes it into the kitchen. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS343
00:56:24,00 --> 00:56:28,50
SOMEONE looks around. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS344
00:56:32,00 --> 00:56:36,50
He hurries over. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS345
00:57:19,00 --> 00:57:24,50
Entering, SOMEONE frowns at seeing SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS346
00:57:24,00 --> 00:57:30,50
SOMEONE gives a comprehending nod, then smiles at him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS347
00:57:28,00 --> 00:57:33,50
SOMEONE wears a disgruntled look. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS348
00:57:43,00 --> 00:57:50,50
Smiling tightly, she jerks her to the side, then moves off. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS349
00:57:47,00 --> 00:57:52,50
SOMEONE follows with a long sigh. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS350
00:57:49,00 --> 00:57:54,50
SOMEONE peers after them as they enter another room. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS351
00:58:21,00 --> 00:58:26,50
SOMEONE stares with disbelieving eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS352
00:58:25,00 --> 00:58:29,50
She blinks up at him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS353
00:58:33,00 --> 00:58:39,50
Following her into the hall, he glances at George, who looks away. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS354
00:58:36,00 --> 00:58:41,50
Now SOMEONE packs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS355
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:06,50
SOMEONE opens the front door and SOMEONE stalks to the elevator with her bags and suitcases in tow. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS356
00:59:03,00 --> 00:59:10,50
She steps inside and hits a button. As the doors slide shut, SOMEONE shakes his head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS357
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:20,50
He pats SOMEONE's shoulder. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS358
00:59:17,00 --> 00:59:24,50
Now SOMEONE races down the stairwell, jumping onto each landing as he rounds the next flight. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS359
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:28,50
In the lobby, the doorman rushes to keep ahead of SOMEONE and opens the door for her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS360
00:59:29,00 --> 00:59:33,50
She marches outside. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS361
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:46,50
SOMEONE dashes out the main door. Spotting SOMEONE he skids to a stop and puts on a casual expression. He pretends to gaze down the street. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS362
00:59:43,00 --> 00:59:48,50
He grins. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS363
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:04,50
He takes a bag. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS364
01:00:02,00 --> 01:00:06,50
He tips the doorman. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS365
01:00:06,00 --> 01:00:10,50
He and SOMEONE start off down the street. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS367
01:00:12,00 --> 01:00:18,50
As they head to a bus stop, the doorman answers an intercom phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS368
01:00:21,00 --> 01:00:29,50
He sets down the phone receiver and jogs toward George, who waits behind SOMEONE a short distance away. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS369
01:00:26,00 --> 01:00:31,50
As the doorman opens his mouth to call him 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS370
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:36,50
he notices SOMEONE shaking his head giddily then looking skyward with a grateful smile. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS371
01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:39,50
Grinning sympathetically, SOMEONE returns to the intercom. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS372
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:49,50
He watches as SOMEONE follows SOMEONE on to a bus, hauling up her roller bag. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS373
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:59,50
Later at his downsized apartment, SOMEONE helps SOMEONE carry in her luggage. She sets down her bags, then takes out her cellphone and charger. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS374
01:01:00,00 --> 01:01:04,50
She notes SOMEONE's boxes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS375
01:01:12,00 --> 01:01:17,50
His fridge is packed with food from SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS376
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:20,50
He checks his cell and ignores a call from dad. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS377
01:01:34,00 --> 01:01:38,50
He enters the kitchen. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS378
01:01:41,00 --> 01:01:48,50
She opens his fridge, finding the vast array of neatly labeled homemade items. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS379
01:01:53,00 --> 01:01:59,50
As SOMEONE sets his jacket down she joins him at the counter and grabs a fork. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS380
01:01:59,00 --> 01:02:07,50
SOMEONE leaves the galley kitchen and unplugs her cellphone from its charger. She steps aside. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS381
01:02:17,00 --> 01:02:20,50
He peeks at her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS382
01:02:19,00 --> 01:02:25,50
Rolling up his sleeves, he smirks. She faces him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS383
01:02:29,00 --> 01:02:34,50
She tosses down her phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS384
01:02:51,00 --> 01:02:55,50
SOMEONE considers the idea. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS385
01:03:02,00 --> 01:03:06,50
She frowns. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS386
01:03:20,00 --> 01:03:24,50
He crosses to the door. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS387
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:46,50
SOMEONE deflates. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS388
01:03:46,00 --> 01:03:54,50
Left alone in the cluttered second floor apartment she glances around and wanders over to a bay window. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS389
01:03:52,00 --> 01:04:00,50
Peering outside she spots SOMEONE who holds up a six-pack of Guinness on his way back across the 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS390
01:04:02,00 --> 01:04:06,50
He runs in front of an oncoming car. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS391
01:04:04,00 --> 01:04:09,50
He barely avoids getting hit. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS392
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:12,50
SOMEONE shakes her head and leaves the window. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS393
01:04:12,00 --> 01:04:15,50
Now on the phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS394
01:04:32,00 --> 01:04:37,50
SOMEONE slides open his cellphone and aims it at his sad face. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS395
01:04:38,00 --> 01:04:43,50
He checks the pic, then sets up a second shot. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS396
01:04:43,00 --> 01:04:49,50
He tilts his head and milks the pout a little more. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS397
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:58,50
Now SOMEONE adds three dashes of bitters to highball glass, drops in a single sugar cube and measures some Maker's SOMEONE in a metal shot cup. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS398
01:04:55,00 --> 01:05:02,50
In the living room, SOMEONE grabs her near-empty glass of Guinness and takes a sip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS399
01:04:59,00 --> 01:05:05,50
SOMEONE squints as he stirs his creation, then smiles. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS400
01:05:07,00 --> 01:05:11,50
He shakes the drink. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS401
01:05:10,00 --> 01:05:14,50
SOMEONE hears him singing. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS402
01:05:23,00 --> 01:05:30,50
She turns to eye him and he stares back, then enters the living room with two cocktails. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS403
01:05:34,00 --> 01:05:38,50
SOMEONE downs the last of her Guinness. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS404
01:05:39,00 --> 01:05:45,50
She accepts the cloudy, peach tinted beverage. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS405
01:05:42,00 --> 01:05:46,50
SOMEONE sits across from her on the floor. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS406
01:05:57,00 --> 01:06:01,50
He raises his glass. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS407
01:06:00,00 --> 01:06:05,50
He taps her, then taps her again. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS408
01:06:06,00 --> 01:06:10,50
She sets her drink aside. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS409
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:39,50
He stands. SOMEONE straightens her posture. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS411
01:08:22,00 --> 01:08:26,50
She sits up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS412
01:08:23,00 --> 01:08:27,50
SOMEONE sits beside her on the couch. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS413
01:08:29,00 --> 01:08:35,50
She squints distantly then gestures with her sleeve-covered hand. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS414
01:09:15,00 --> 01:09:22,50
SOMEONE lowers her tearful gaze, then notes SOMEONE beside her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS415
01:09:19,00 --> 01:09:24,50
She self-consciously stands up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS416
01:09:24,00 --> 01:09:29,50
She tugs the hem of her shirt and rubs her nose. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS417
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:33,50
