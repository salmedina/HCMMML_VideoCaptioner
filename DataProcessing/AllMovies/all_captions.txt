In the dusty air, he spies a shape approaching and throws his ax. Dodging it, the charging vampire reappears. SOMEONE sidesteps and decapitates him on a vault shelf.
Later, the banker’s head lies upside down in a grave.
SOMEONE buries him amid several other graves. In a smithy, a powerfully build vampire blocks SOMEONE's attack and bends him back over the forge. The hunter stomps on a bellows and the blazing flame sends the vampire reeling back. SOMEONE grabs him and thrusts his head into the fire repeatedly stomping on the bellows. Now on a picnic with SOMEONE, SOMEONE dozes off spilling a cup of tea.
She nods. SOMEONE takes her cup and sets it down then takes her hands in his.
He leans forward, staring up at her earnestly.
SOMEONE turns her head away and presses her lips together suppressing a smile.
She smiles playfully.
With a modest smirk, he gives a dismissive wave.
That night, as SOMEONE trots down a sidewalk, SOMEONE follows clapping the picnic basket lid like a yapping mouth.
The reach a house gate and face each other, sharing a warm smile.
Beaming hopefully, SOMEONE steps closer and rises up on her toes leaning her face toward his.
Considerably taller.
SOMEONE takes a deep breath and makes no move to meet her.
SOMEONE removes his hat, sets it on the ground and steps up on it.
As she leans in, he turns his cheek to her lips.
SOMEONE nods.
Taking a deep breath, she steps down and picks up his hat.
She manages a bright smile and heads for the house.
Gazing after her, SOMEONE trips.
From across the street, a one-eyed SOMEONE leers at the tender scene.
Stepping forward, he sees SOMEONE pause at the door to watch her suitor go.
Now in the deep South, a veiled woman rides a horse up a dirt path to a plantation house. Trees dripping with Spanish moss provide a canopy overhead.
Later, she strides into a dining room where SOMEONE sits alone at a table.
She slaps a newspaper down before him and sits.
SOMEONE ignores it. She slides the paper closer and he turns.
Boasting strawberry blonde tresses and sultry features, SOMEONE puffs a pipe.
Frowning, SOMEONE takes up the paper and reads a headline.
Six headless bodies found near Springfield. SOMEONE Stibble Jr among the dead.
Smirking, SOMEONE lifts his brow.
Now in the general store, SOMEONE reads a book. An African-American man steps inside, takes off his hat and shuts the door.
SOMEONE eyes the visitor from his desk
Noticing a scar on the visitor's cheek, SOMEONE remembers.
He hops over the counter and hugs him.
He takes off his apron.
SOMEONE ducks a swipe from the first man then SOMEONE strikes again. Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in a jail cell. SOMEONE paces outside the bars.
She reaches through the bars and turns SOMEONE's head.
Daytime. On a street corner, SOMEONE addresses a crowd from a soapbox.
SOMEONE rides up in a carriage.
SOMEONE steps down from his soapbox and the crowd gathers around him.
He walks with an older man wearing sunglasses.
SOMEONE opens a carriage door and the man hands him his card.
SOMEONE climbs into his carriage then shakes SOMEONE's hand.
The carriage rides off revealing SOMEONE. He and SOMEONE walk together.
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE presents a silver pocket watch with an engraving.
A SOMEONE. Time waits for no man. SOMEONE.
SOMEONE glances at his mentor then heads off.
He turns back.
The tall young man hurries away.
Gin Creek. Our view roves toward the shipping warehouse across the dock.
SOMEONE sidles around the exterior of the building, his silver tipped ax in hand.
He stops at a corner.
Returning from a corral, SOMEONE throws down a pitchfork.
He stops and sniffs the air.
Grimacing, he takes of his sunglasses.
SOMEONE attacks.
SOMEONE backs away.
He flees among his frightened horses. An aerial view shows the herd crossing a riverside field. As the vampire runs up ahead, SOMEONE mounts one of the horses.
SOMEONE leaps forward between two horses, grabs onto their necks and hangs between them.
He slams the horses into the ground and they tumble across the dirt obstructing SOMEONE's path. As SOMEONE jumps one of the horses, he falls off his own. He rolls to a stop and stands up to find himself facing the oncoming stampede. A horse brushes past him and he staggers. A second and third knock him around. He spots SOMEONE leaping over the herd.
The vampire tackles him and bares his fangs.
SOMEONE blocks him with the shaft of his ax. They both see a horse charging straight for them.
The stallion knocks SOMEONE off SOMEONE sending him tumbling across the dirt. The vampire rises to his feet. He boldly grabs the front leg of an oncoming horse, flipping the steed on its back. Using the horse like a track and field hammer, he hurls it at his enemy knocking him to the ground. Amid the chaos of the stampede, the horse rises with SOMEONE on its back.
The vampire hunter rides on leaning down for his ax as he passes. Up ahead, SOMEONE bounds off the back of two horses and mounts a third. SOMEONE nears his target holding his ax at the ready. SOMEONE glances back over his shoulder.
He ducks the swing of the ax. SOMEONE leans back as SOMEONE throws a roundhouse kick. The vampire grabs the ax and flips SOMEONE on to the back of another horse. As SOMEONE mounts the horse, he sees SOMEONE run off across the backs of the herd. SOMEONE attempts to stand on his horse's back.
He rises to his feet then runs after the vampire landing on a new horse's back with every daring step. Through a veil of wafting dust, we glimpse SOMEONE as he looks back and grins.
SOMEONE lunges at him swiping at his legs, but the vampire jumps, flips and lands on a horse behind SOMEONE. He tries to bite SOMEONE's exposed neck, but the vampire hunter blocks the bite with his ax and pushes them off the horse. SOMEONE clings to SOMEONE's boot as the herd runs alongside a bluff. He lets go.
SOMEONE falls off the horse and tumbles down the face of the bluff. Rolling to a stop, he loses his ax. SOMEONE pounces on him and bares his hideous fangs. SOMEONE's spots his weapon and reaches for it, but SOMEONE stomps the handle flipping the ax into the air.
The vampire grabs the ax and nearly splits SOMEONE's face. SOMEONE grabs the shaft, extends it to reveal a hidden trigger, then shoots SOMEONE through his good eye. SOMEONE lands on his back. Standing over him, SOMEONE collapses his modified weapon and readies himself for a final strike.
SOMEONE brings down his ax. Now at night, a man forces a young woman through a narrow alley.
He slams her against a brick wall clutching her throat.
Behind the man, SOMEONE steps out from a shadowy recess across the alley.
With a calm, deliberate gaze, he nears the rapist's exposed neck and takes a bite.
As the vampire brings his flailing victim down, the young woman escapes down the alley.
SOMEONE steps out from around a corner and catches his bloodsucking mentor in the act.

Cautiously, he approaches SOMEONE.

In a flashback, on a tree-lined road, SOMEONE hops out of his carriage and takes a look at its wheel.
As he kisses a woman leaning out of the window, he notices a team of riders approaching.
The dark haired woman sits back and SOMEONE hands her a gun.
He draws a dagger.
As SOMEONE approaches the group, a rider hops down from his horse and disappears. As the others look on, the unshaven man holds his ground awaiting the imminent attack.
The vampire appears and SOMEONE dodges a swipe. He ducks another, then slashes his attacker's masked mouth creating a spectacular spray of gore.
A mildly frustrated SOMEONE dismounts. SOMEONE tries to stab his attacker, but the vampire clutches his wrist. He drops his dagger, catches it with his free hand, then slashes and leg sweeps his foe. He slashes a second attacker's kicking leg, then drives his blade through the vampire's palm and flips him onto his back.
SOMEONE nears. SOMEONE attacks, but the seasoned vampire deflects his every strike. He kicks the human in the face. In slow motion, SOMEONE twirls through the air and lands at SOMEONE's feet. The vampire takes off his sunglasses revealing his puffy eyes. SOMEONE kicks out SOMEONE's shin and the vampire almost falls on his dagger. From behind, SOMEONE's love attacks SOMEONE, but two minions seize her. SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE from behind, exposes his neck and sinks his teeth in.
SOMEONE looks up from his trembling victim, his mouth dripping with blood.
He grabs a tuft of SOMEONE's hair and lowers him to his knee.
As SOMEONE crosses to the dark haired woman, a dazed SOMEONE rises to his feet but struggles to maintain his balance. He watches SOMEONE wrap his arms around her.
Sinking his teeth into her neck, he spins her around lifting her off her feet.
SOMEONE's eyes roll back.
He watches the attack in a stupor, his jaw hanging slack.
SOMEONE slows his spin to a stop then let's his victim sink to the ground.
Trembling, face down, SOMEONE watches his dead love.
With his boot, SOMEONE rolls her on her back.
SOMEONE shakes his head.
Baring his newfound fangs, SOMEONE grabs his dagger and charges the vampire. He goes to strike, but his arm stops mid-stab. With both hands, he swipes at SOMEONE and attempts to stab him in the heart, but an unseen force holds the blade back.
SOMEONE lowers his demoralized gaze.
SOMEONE leaves him standing alone.
SOMEONE glances back at the riders then goes to his love's side.
He gently turns her face to his own and kisses her on the lips.
Back in the present.
Beside SOMEONE, SOMEONE rises to his feet.
The seated vampire meets his gaze.
As SOMEONE walks away, a flash of lightning brightens the alley's walls.
Now through a downpour, the tall, young man crosses a street.
Wearing his top hat and overcoat.
He steps onto a curb and crosses a sidewalk heading for the general store.
As he unlocks the front door, someone approaches him from behind.
As SOMEONE looks up from the door, a hooded figure nears.
Pulling his ax from his jacket, he turns to strike.
SOMEONE reaches into his jacket.
SOMEONE watches as he takes a knee and holds up a ring.
Gazing at the ring, she takes a deep breath.
As SOMEONE offers her hand, SOMEONE rises to his feet and puts the ring on her finger.
They share a loving smile then SOMEONE cradles SOMEONE's cheeks.
She rests her hands on his shoulders and they kiss.
The tall, young man lifts his fiancée into his arms.
He carries her off leaving his ax behind.
Now at an intimate wedding ceremony.
Holding hands, SOMEONE and SOMEONE kiss.
Later, the smiling bride and groom clink their glasses and sip champagne.
SOMEONE shakes SOMEONE's hand.
SOMEONE looks on.

As he heads off, SOMEONE reads from the book leaning against the wall.
One of the two men steps down beside SOMEONE then clubs him.
Now SOMEONE finds SOMEONE in his study.
SOMEONE takes a seat and hands SOMEONE the book.
He finds a flowery invitation inside. SOMEONE quickly gathers his jacket and hat.
Now on a boat.
They stand on the deck of their humble vessel as it approaches a fleet of steam-powered riverboats crowding a bustling harbor. Pillars of black smoke plume skyward for miles.
New Orleans.
Now, Spanish moss hangs low from the branches of surrounding trees as SOMEONE and SOMEONE ride a modest horse drawn carriage up a narrow path.
On either side, wooden shacks show no sign of inhabitance.
A pot hangs over a stack of firewood.
From inside a shack, a mocha-skinned woman with a head-kerchief wields a rifle as she peers out through a gap in the wood slat wall.
At night, the carriage approaches the plantation house.
The moonlit Spanish moss over their head sways eerily in a breeze.
Now, a window reflects burning candles and frames SOMEONE and SOMEONE as they walk up to the house.
Peering in, they find white people waltzing with slaves at a ball.
Among them, SOMEONE recoils from SOMEONE as she holds him tight.
SOMEONE draws his ax.
He hurries away. Inside.
SOMEONE lunges at SOMEONE baring her fangs.
As SOMEONE stares, the vampires attack the slaves. SOMEONE wrenches free, but the shy woman succumbs to a vicious bite. SOMEONE watches pleasurably.
As SOMEONE fight off the attacker, slaves all around him fall victim to the vamps. Two grab SOMEONE. SOMEONE kicks open the door and races in as a few survivors flee.
Seated in a chair, SOMEONE smirks while two of his underlings hold SOMEONE on his knees. One story up, two vampires in a mural turn. They leap from a ledge in front of the painting and claw the wood floor.
Charging, they disappear. SOMEONE throws his hat at one then strikes him down. He takes down the other in a single strike.
Swinging at a third, SOMEONE drops his ax. He delivers a powerful roundhouse kick as more and more vampires join the fray, a staring SOMEONE backs away from the window. One vampire seizes SOMEONE's ax. The hunter kicks him away and twirls it into an upward swing taking out one vamp after another. Looking on, SOMEONE discreetly works through ropes binding his wrists. An invisible vampire grabs a sword then materializes to attack. SOMEONE disarms him, but three more surround him.
As he swings at one, it vanishes. Another swipes his claws. SOMEONE ducks them then embeds his ax in the creature's abdomen.
In slow motion, he wrenches the weapon out sending a splash of blood through the air.
As he finishes the vampire off, SOMEONE frees himself and fights off his captor. SOMEONE kicks him into a pillar splintering its wood. Propelling himself off another pillar, SOMEONE takes out two vamps in a single swing. SOMEONE stalks towards him as he fights a third. SOMEONE beheads his foe and finds SOMEONE in pants, swirling her long skirt like a cape. Slicing through it he finds her gone.
From behind, she kicks him to the floor as SOMEONE throws her a chair. She backflips through the air catches it and lands in the seat on top of SOMEONE. Straddling the chair, she peers down at his face.
She pins his arms beneath her boot.
The high mural becomes an animated depiction of slavery throughout world history.
He crouches beside SOMEONE.
Standing, SOMEONE steps away.
A vamp holds SOMEONE.
SOMEONE struggles.
SOMEONE puts a dagger to SOMEONE's throat.
The horse drawn carriage crashes through a window.
SOMEONE fights free as SOMEONE drives in. The carriage skids in blood knocking SOMEONE off of SOMEONE. He grabs his ax.
He and SOMEONE catch up to the carriage and climb on to the back. It loses a wheel as it speeds out, but continues down the dirt path. Later, they run.
They halt in their tracks.
A team of horsemen approach.
The mocha-skinned woman rows a raft.
The three man dash from the riverbank and find the raft waiting for them. Trees hide them as the horsemen ride past with a colony of bats swooping overhead. On the raft, the men and their rescuer duck low.
As the danger passes, SOMEONE stands and takes up the long poled oar.
At dawn, we gaze out over the winding bayou.
Later, the raft arrives at a shore facing a stately brick church.
SOMEONE gets off first and helps the others.
He and SOMEONE pull the raft up on shore then follow the woman with SOMEONE.
A pastor comes out to meet them.
Now as SOMEONE climbs into an attic.
SOMEONE offers a hand to help him up.

SOMEONE shoots a cutting look at SOMEONE who lowers his gaze.
SOMEONE twirls his ax.
SOMEONE lays the ax in a chest.
Now, our view spirals from sideways to upright as a door opens and a tall, silhouetted figure strides through.
Clad in a trim long coat and the famous stovepipe hat, SOMEONE marches resolutely towards us. As he draws near, we find him aged and distinguished.
Sporting his trademark presidential beard. Now before the Capitol with its dome under construction.
As a canon fires, words appear: Fort Sumter, 1861. Within the fort, Union and Confederate troops clash in a chaotic battle as smoke fills the air. A bearded Union General leads a charge. Now, the wall of a toy fort topples as a young boy plays in the Oval Office.
As SOMEONE reads a letter, SOMEONE arrives.
The men turn and the boy looks up from his play.
SOMEONE lowers his troubled gaze and SOMEONE steps away.
A gracefully aging SOMEONE approaches the desk with a meal on a tray.
She plants her hands on her hips and her gaze falls on a headline.
20,000 soldiers dead.
SOMEONE shifts his sorrowful gaze and SOMEONE heads out.
The young boy follows his mother.
The child pauses.
Turning around, he returns to his father's desk and kisses his sunken cheek.
The boy goes to his namesake who kisses his cheek.
Beaming shyly, the little boy leaves with a jaunty stride.
SOMEONE gazes after him lovingly as SOMEONE tosses down a paper.
The Emancipation Proclamation lies before him.
He signs it. Now before Congress.
Outside the Capitol.
Now in the White House, a maid uses a feather duster on a clock. It's SOMEONE.
Later, she smiles and nods demurely as she passes SOMEONE.
SOMEONE pauses briefly looking over her shoulder at the sultry woman.
SOMEONE slips into a bedroom where SOMEONE wears a Union uniform as he plays with toy soldiers.
She shuts the door.
Coming close, SOMEONE lays down on her stomach.
Props herself on her elbows and chats sweetly with the child.
As he answers her, she glances over her shoulder.
SOMEONE blows a toy horn and they share a mirthful smile.
His hand close to hers, he presents a gleaming toy sword made of silver.
She takes his hand and kisses his wrist. The toy sword drops to the carpet.
Now SOMEONE comes in as SOMEONE lies sick in bed.
Sitting with SOMEONE on the bed, he notices dark, swollen veins branching from a bite on the boy's wrist. SOMEONE's eyes widen and he stands. Watching him, SOMEONE notices his stricken gaze as he looks away.
Stepping away, SOMEONE crosses to a sunlit window.
SOMEONE turns and faces him questioningly.
Staring off, SOMEONE remembers his dying mother writhing as her eyes rolled back in her head.
Now the President wakes in a chair at SOMEONE's bedside.
Stretching, he finds SOMEONE sleeping on the bed cradling their son in her arms.
Moving gingerly, SOMEONE gets to his feet.
His gaze lands on a spot on the carpet.
He drapes his jacket over SOMEONE like a blanket.
Then crouches at his toys. The silver pocket watch gleams among them.
SOMEONE picks it up and opens it revealing SOMEONE's personalized inscription.
He lifts his stunned gaze.
Now, SOMEONE steps out onto a balcony on a beautiful day and pauses.
Turning, he finds SOMEONE sitting on the concrete.
His long legs stretched out before him.
He slumps dejectedly against a pillar.
SOMEONE crosses to his lifelong friend and drapes his jacket around his shoulders.
Stepping in front of SOMEONE, he crouches and touches his arm.
SOMEONE offers a sympathetic gaze, then straightens and stands over him.
The President looks up at him.
SOMEONE draws a deep knowing breath and gazes off.
Nighttime. A carriage rides past the mist-enshrouded White House.
In the presidential home, SOMEONE kneels at SOMEONE's bed in prayer.
Before him, the lifeless child wears a dark suit.
His hands clasped demurely.
SOMEONE comes in and sinks to his knees at the other side of the bed.
The President lifts his head staring off as he rubs his thumbs together.
Looking past SOMEONE, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE arriving in the doorway dressed in mourning.
SOMEONE stands. SOMEONE nods wearily.
She beats his chest.
Overwhelmed with sobs, SOMEONE rushes from the room.
SOMEONE starts to go then pauses in the doorway.
SOMEONE's eyes widen and he lowers his remorseful gaze.
Now a photographer stands in the middle of a field littered with the bodies of Union soldiers.
In the Oval Office.
Leaving the room, he hands over a telegram order.
On SOMEONE's plantation, we zoom up the path leading to his door.
It opens as he walks out a man with a bearded chin.
A servant brings red beverages.
SOMEONE takes up the goblets.
SOMEONE returns a goblet.
Sipping his drink, SOMEONE spits it out. Splotches of red stain a war map in his hand.
Our view zooms in on a red stain north of Gettysburg which becomes a smoking field beneath an overcast sky. Swooping low, we find Confederate soldiers charging recklessly over the grass as cannon balls touch down all around them.
Union soldiers fire the canons from a high ridge.
As a cannonball touches down with a stories high blast, Confederate soldier march straight towards it. A row of cannon barrels amid smoke and sparks as they fire. In the infantry below, a thin Union soldier clutches a photo of a woman as he stands by the bearded General.
The thin soldier aims a rifle with his brothers-in-arms.
A cannon ball blasts behind the Confederates.
One or two fall, but the rest charge on seemingly unharmed by the bullets. They drop their rifles. The thin soldier faces his General.
A pale Confederate runs on despite a blood spraying chest wound and a bullet through his hand. Another bears his fangs. As the General shoots, the Confederates vanish. A force knocks his head off and his men fall behind him.
A Confederate flag topples to the ground.
The General turns and finds the thin soldier spitting up blood beside him.
He holds up a shaking hand and a shaft of light shining through a hole in his chest hits his palm.
He sinks to his knees then keels over.
Turning, the General finds every man in his unit sprawled on the ground.
The thin soldier's photograph of his sweetheart flutters down to the grass. The General stares at the departing Confederates.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE dine at opposite ends of a long table.
SOMEONE's sips her drink and takes up her soupspoon.
SOMEONE turns the silver utensil in his hand.
SOMEONE watches him with wide eyes. The President springs up from his seat.
He shows the utensil.
Now, Union soldiers move in and out of wealthy residences bringing out bulging sacks and armloads of silver items. As we peer down through the clouds, we find carts loaded with silver twinkling in the sunlight as they travel through the streets. SOMEONE enters his house and peers out a window through his sunglasses. Now, Speed rides in a carriage with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE eyes the vampire uneasily.
In a factory, SOMEONE watches workers melt the silver.
SOMEONE joins him at a high railing overlooking the work floor.
The molten silver churns in enormous vats. SOMEONE faces his old friend who looks down with a thoughtful gaze.
Now fog drifts over the White House lawn at dusk.
In SOMEONE's room, SOMEONE lies in the small bed in a demure white nightgown.
She keeps her melancholy gaze averted as SOMEONE arrives.
He sits close, his back to her.
SOMEONE's expression softens as she stares towards the windows, one hand tucked behind her head.
She rolls her head to face him.
SOMEONE sits up, her long hair hanging loose around her shoulders.
SOMEONE turns over his shoulder to meet her gaze.
Wearing a vulnerable frown, she takes a deep breath.
SOMEONE slumps regretfully then puts his arms around her.
The aging couple lies back on the bed in a warm embrace.
SOMEONE fingers SOMEONE's toy sword as SOMEONE cups her hand in his.
SOMEONE hosts her in the dining room.
Now the attic door opens.
Light pours in past SOMEONE as he stands in the doorway staring at the now dust coated chest.
He crosses to it slowly taking out a key.
Unlocking it, he lifts the lid and gazes in.
SOMEONE pensively takes out his specialized ax and finds the silver along the blade untarnished.
Tipping it, he holds it firmly in both hands and regards it nostalgically.
SOMEONE slowly twirls the weapon in both hands.
Gaining confidence, he builds speed until the ax spins in a blur.
It slips from his grasp.
Bracing one hand on the chest, SOMEONE clenches a fist and softly pounds the chest lid.
In a battle tent.
Wearing his broad-brimmed hat, SOMEONE leans forward, his hands on a table.
With SOMEONE and SOMEONE.
In Gettysburg, SOMEONE strides to the open flap of his tent where SOMEONE stands post.
SOMEONE slides his pocket watch over a trajectory marked on a map. It becomes a locomotive speeding along a track in the darkness.
Sidling along the engine's outer railing.
SOMEONE reaches the front and wipes off the headlamp.
He climbs back into the engine car where SOMEONE writes in his journal.
Pausing, the President looks up at his old friend.
Heading further into the car, a soot-smeared SOMEONE catches SOMEONE watching him and pauses with a frown.
He shifts his gaze.
SOMEONE regards his old friend solemnly. A net of chains rattles over SOMEONE's head as he returns the gaze with a faint smile.
Removing a pair of spectacles, the President takes up his ax and turns away. Now on a narrow path in the woods, SOMEONE, SOMEONE and a few underlings approach on horseback. Facing them, Ms. Tubman stays SOMEONE who draws up her cloaks hood.
Riding ahead, SOMEONE passes Ms. Tubman and looms over SOMEONE on her horse.
She halts close to the First Lady who keeps her face hidden.
SOMEONE draws a long, slim blade and points it at her head.
She pushes her hood back a few inches.
SOMEONE reluctantly obeys.
SOMEONE stares as the vampires ride off from whence they came.
Behind the First Lady, dozens of African-Americans emerge from hiding with sacks and baskets.
They join SOMEONE on the path out of Washington.
Meanwhile, the locomotive races through the darkness.
Stepping into the car behind it, SOMEONE slides its door shut.
Stacks of crates fill both sides of the car.
Stepping past, SOMEONE pauses, raises his ax and turns.
From the engine, SOMEONE leans out a window and spots several vampires leaping onto the freight cars.
He lunges back into the car with a smile. In a freight car, SOMEONE loads his six-shooter with silver rounds.
Pausing, he looks up.
SOMEONE frowns and gets to his feet, readying his gun.
A lantern swings from its post over his head as he steps over the wood plank floor.
Turning, he raises his weapon.
He moves to a shuttered hatch and slides it open, aiming into the darkness.
SOMEONE slides it shut then turns to face another shuttered hatch. He takes aim and reaches out to open it.
Hands burst through the baseboards and grab his ankles. SOMEONE falls back and the vampire starts to pull him out.
He fires a gun in each hand then scrambles free.
SOMEONE limps to a crate.
As he looks up, a vampire leaps from the shadows. Grabbing his guns, SOMEONE fires taking him down. He puts his back to the wall and aims in either direction. Arms burst through the wood and hug him from behind. The wounded vampire rises, but SOMEONE shoots him through the forehead. His guns fall from his grasp as he struggles against the vampire holding him. He fights his way free then grabs a huge pistol and blows the monster away. The kickback sends SOMEONE to the floor beside the dead vampire. He opens a door behind the monster letting him fall away.
As he slides it shut, countless more vampires leap onto the roof. SOMEONE hobbles to another car.
SOMEONE goes.
Now between two rail cars.
SOMEONE glances at the barrel of his ax.
SOMEONE gives him a bullet then shakes his hand. SOMEONE heads back inside as his friend climbs up to the rail car's roof. Inside, SOMEONE stabs a vampire with a bayonet attached to the butt of his ax. He pulls the weapon out then ducks past another lapping off his head. On the roof, SOMEONE draws two pistols and shoots a vampire. In slow motion, the monster flies past him spraying blood. Another charges and SOMEONE fires. In slow motion, the shot rips through the vampire's shoulder.
Baring his fangs, he lunges at SOMEONE. SOMEONE flings him aside, but loses his balance nearly stepping over the roof's edge.
He regains his footing and hurries on to a vampire turning a hand wheel. Sparks fly from a wheel of the train. SOMEONE's guns misfire. The vampire bares his hideous fangs. SOMEONE lunges pushing the ghoul to the next rail car ahead.
Rising to his knees, he turns the hand wheel, disengaging the brake. Meanwhile, SOMEONE wedges his ax into a ceiling beam and dropkicks a vampire away. He goes to finish his enemy but finds only shards of wood on the floor.
The vampire jumps on his back. Forced toward an open door, SOMEONE braces himself with his ax. The vampire tries to bite his neck, but he flips his foe out of the rail car decapitating him as he shuts the door. The vampire's head lies at his feet. SOMEONE boots it out. On the roof, still turning the hand wheel, SOMEONE watches his enemy rise to his feet.
SOMEONE turns his head.
The vampire falls aside revealing SOMEONE standing halfway through a hatch, his modified ax in hand. SOMEONE spots a vampire climbing on to the roof. He grabs his partner's weapon and attacks the new arrival knocking the monster over the edge. He tosses the ax back to SOMEONE who chops into another. With SOMEONE's blade stuck in his fallen foe, a vampire attacks with kicks and punches. As SOMEONE fends off the attacker, SOMEONE lifts his ax, twirls it, releasing a spray of blood, then slashes off the vampire's head. In the same swing, he strikes another vampire's midsection. He massacres another, slashing his face several times, then passes the ax to SOMEONE. SOMEONE takes out two vampires then twirls the ax behind his back to SOMEONE who spins the versatile weapon and strikes another vampire with its butt. Through a veil of wind-swept steam, SOMEONE vanquishes yet another vampire. He brings his ax down once more.
The steam dissipates to reveal SOMEONE clutching the ax handle. He kicks SOMEONE, sending the President back. SOMEONE lands between the railcars in a tangle of chains. SOMEONE breaks the ax-handle over his knee. As SOMEONE climbs back onto the roof, SOMEONE hurls a knife.
The knife's tip nears SOMEONE's face, but the calm vampire tilts his head and dodges the blade. SOMEONE charges SOMEONE, but gets knocked off his feet.
As he slides head first over the edge, SOMEONE grabs his ankle.
Revolvers fall from the dangling man's pockets. As the train speeds alongside a wall, SOMEONE nearly crashes into some jutting rocks.
SOMEONE clutches SOMEONE's collar.
SOMEONE sinks his teeth into flesh, but finds himself biting SOMEONE's arm.
He kicks off the passing rock wall and lands facing his rival. As SOMEONE ducks a punch, the pair gets jostled atop the last railcar. Meanwhile, SOMEONE exhales a puff of thick smoke.
With a match, she lights a rope sending flames up a beam.
As she marches off, a massive fire consumes the entire support structure of a bridge. SOMEONE catches SOMEONE's arm then flips him. Grabs his leg and slams him through the roof. With an avalanche of broken wood, the vampires crash land on the floor of the railcar. SOMEONE rises to his feet and slams SOMEONE's face through the top of a wooden crate.
SOMEONE lifts the laughing vampire from the box then shoves him aside and peeks in the hole himself.
He pulls out a common rock.
Then looks up from the stone with a knowing gaze.
He tosses the rock and crosses to another crate. Inspecting the cargo, he finds more rocks in place of the silver.
SOMEONE angrily paces away. He kicks open another crate, spilling rocks on the floor.
SOMEONE boots SOMEONE back into a corner. The evil vampire glares.
As the train nears the burning bridge, SOMEONE eyes the blaze from the locomotive. He pulls back a lever, uses a piece of wood to keep it in place then leaves the controls. He enters the first railcar and staggers past the dummy cargo.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE helps SOMEONE onto the roof. They rise to their feet and spot the burning bridge up ahead. They start for the locomotive but stop short.
They turn back.
They run back across the rooftops.
Making his way through the railcars, SOMEONE finds a floor strewn with broken wood. He spots SOMEONE unconscious on his back, then looks up through the open ceiling.
Turning around, he finds himself face to face with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE's throat.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE arrive to see SOMEONE bite into SOMEONE's neck.
The vampire looks up at them. Now, as the train passes over the burning bridge, the track splits and the last railcar breaks loose from the train. Left behind, the railcar teeters over a ledge sending SOMEONE and SOMEONE sliding down its roof. About to fall into the blaze below, they daringly leap across the divide and land on the next rail car's roof.
As what's left of the train races onward, the burning bridge collapses in its wake. Jostling inside a railcar, SOMEONE braces himself and SOMEONE rises to his knees. Their railcar breaks free from the train crashing into the support structure below the track.

As the remaining bridge buckles, the locomotive struggles to climb the increasingly inclined track. SOMEONE peeks over the side glimpsing the burning structure underneath. He and SOMEONE make their way across the engine. The locomotive’s wheels spin kicking up sparks. Before the engine reaches the end, the bridge underneath it splits from the final portion of the track. SOMEONE and SOMEONE brace themselves, clinging to the engine. More sparks fly as the train begins to slide backward. Just before it slips off the edge, the locomotive starts to climb the angled track.

Elsewhere, SOMEONE carries a crossbow to a tree trunk stump with two arrows. Plopping the weapon on the ground, he quizzically eyes SOMEONE a short distance away. The caretaker stands alone among the headstones, gesturing conversationally and nodding as if talking to someone. SOMEONE keeps his gaze locked on his boss as he uses a pair of pliers to tug a crossbow bolt out of the tree. SOMEONE nods, seemingly to no one.
He beams and strolls off toward the forest. SOMEONE watches tearfully.

He grabs the magazine and runs off.
He reads the article.
He holds the open magazine against his leg and smooth's its wrinkled pages. Night time. At the cemetery, a light above the boat shed's open barn door illuminates the bow of SOMEONE's neglected sailboat inside. In his work area, he sketches at a drafting table. The boating magazine rests above his paper open to pictures and diagrams of SOMEONE's canting keel. He leans back in his chair and glances around absentmindedly with his pencil.
Later, he rests his head on his hand, his brow furrowed. Lifting his gaze, he strokes his chin thoughtfully and stares at a calendar on the wall. Its monthly picture shows a whale's tail fin curved upward.
Now at the docks, our view glides from the blue and red hull of SOMEONE's sloop to SOMEONE sketching the sailboat.

A lamp at the dock's railing illuminates his lonesome figure.
Now, SOMEONE cautiously grabs a suspended safety wire running along the side of SOMEONE's sloop. He slides his hand across it as he walks the length of the deck. The vessel's lowered sails rest loosely around the boom, their folds draped over the cabin's roof. SOMEONE sweeps his gaze up at taut vertical line,

SOMEONE blinks, his gaze stricken.
She leaves the cabin with a coy smirk. Turning, SOMEONE plants his hands on the kitchen door frame and leans far back. He straightens, checks his watch, and checks the sunset chart. Pounding it with his fist, he pulls a curtain aside and watches SOMEONE walk away through a warped glass window.

Now, in jeans and a T-shirt, SOMEONE hikes up the waterside path leading to the caretaker's grounds. He breaks into a brief jog, rubbing his eyes. Reaching the cabin, he finds a slip of paper tacked to the door bearing a doodle of the Splendid Splinter. A handwritten note on the back reads come find me. Turning the slip over, SOMEONE reads the message and smiles. He jogs toward the boat shed which sits with its barn doors closed. Turning to the bay, he finds SOMEONE manning his old skiff.

He straightens a little, his eyes on the charts. Clad in a deep blue shirt, his strong back flexes as he catches his breath.
SOMEONE opens a bureau drawer.
Reaching inside, he strokes his baseball mitt, then firmly lays it flat. He leans over the open drawer, his eyes un-waveringly on its contents.

The fair skinned brunette woman reaches out offering the necklace.
SOMEONE reaches out and accepts.

Bullets hit his chest sending bursts of blood from his back as they tear through him.
SOMEONE flinches slightly at the gun shots.
Tears continue to well up in her eyes as she watches her father in the doorway.

Now our view soars over the city.
SOMEONE runs down a long staircase between the crowded tiers of rundown homes.
As some of his gunmen give chase, SOMEONE talks into his radio.
SOMEONE dashes down the stairs with the three gunmen close behind.
Rounding a corner, she navigates a labyrinth of alleyways. As she nears the end of one alley, her gaze falls on a metal fire escape ladder against the side of an apartment building.
Stepping onto a stack of wooden crates, she grabs the first rung.
She climbs up as the beefy thug arrives in the alley.
He spots her feet disappearing over the rooftop's edge.

The gunmen return to the alley.
A view down a chimney shows SOMEONE huddled at the bottom, rocking slightly with her hand clapped over her mouth.
Now she emerges from an alley onto a quiet road.

Noticing it, she breaks into a run.

Finding herself boxed in, she slides down a storm drain opening and disappears.
The thugs peer after her.
SOMEONE shoots his handgun into the storm drain opening.
The others follow suit with their automatics.
Dust billows into the air from their flying bullets. The motorcyclist and the three guys on foot join the group and peer at the storm drain.
Meanwhile, a manhole cover rises from the middle of a street.
Sliding it aside, SOMEONE lifts her face to the bright sunlight and squints.
She rubs her eyes then glances around and climbs out of the hole.
Cars and pedestrians take little notice as they bustle past the dirty faced girl in her sullied school uniform.
Later, she reaches a building surrounded by a tall wrought iron fence.
Armed soldiers stand posted at its gate.
Consulting the business card from her father,
the dazed girl walks toward one of the security guards.
She offers the card.
Now inside, a man reads a name on it - John C. Davies, Embassy of the United States of America. He gazes at SOMEONE who sits in front of his desk.
As SOMEONE averts her gaze, the American leans closer.
She lifts her eyes to his then glances at an older man at a desk nearby.
Taking a deep breath, she sticks a finger down her throat.
He recoils as she barfs on his desk.
Wiping her mouth, she settles back into her seat and uses one finger to poke around the vomit.
She finds the computer chip and holds it out.
He grabs a tissue.
Grimacing, he uses it to take the chip.
His older colleague watches in disbelief as he cleans it off and places it in a disk which he then inserts into his computer.

His mouth hanging agape, he shifts his astonished gaze to SOMEONE.
Two subordinates leave.
His older colleague hits a button on his desk which activates a camera.
He glances at his computer.

Now we flight toward Acosta City's jutting skyscraper.

Later, SOMEONE and her escort stride down a jet way.
Now a man's hand stamps a passport.
SOMEONE and her escort sit in front of his desk.
The bureaucrat sets a short stack of cash in front of the girl.
With a frown, she grabs the passport and money.
Now a security guard leads her and her escort down a corridor.
As they pass a restroom, SOMEONE tugs on the woman's wrist.
Entering the bathroom, SOMEONE strides to the last stall
which sits beside a row of windows at her eye level.
She steps inside and pulls the door shut.
In the corridor, her escort checks her watch then peers inside the restroom.
Finding the door to the last stall closed, she walks over.
She opens it and finds it empty.
A window lies ajar.
The woman hurries off past the security guard.
Now SOMEONE stands at a ticket kiosk in a bus station.
She hands him the address written out by her father.
She holds up her wad of cash.
Now hazy sunlight glimmers off the mirrored panels of Chicago's skyscrapers as we move over the downtown area.
A Trailways bus crosses a bridge and a bird's eye view follows it up a street.
Inside, SOMEONE rests her arm against a window and stares out at the passing city.
Later, she enters Union Station's great hall and sweeps her gaze around the high ceilinged atrium.
She timidly strides between two columns of benches shooting furtive glances at the other commuter.
SOMEONE reads a comic book as she waits on a platform for an approaching L train.
Its doors open.

Later, SOMEONE walks a dimly lit alleyway
where shady looking men talk along its edges.
She hands the man her scrap of paper with the address.
He reads it then meets her gaze.

The man steps into a dingy room where a tall dark haired figure punches a guy sitting in a chair.
SOMEONE pats his victim's bald head.
Another punch sends thick streams of his blood flying.
SOMEONE wipes sweat from his face.
SOMEONE winds up for another blow.

Now SOMEONE's associate leads SOMEONE into a small waiting area within a network of offices.
As two women leave one of them, she watches them go with a solemn curious gaze.
A tall shadowy figure arrives on the other side of her.
Turning, she finds SOMEONE staring at her through a set of windows.
As he strides around a corner, she watches him through the windows.
SOMEONE arrives before her.
As he drops to his knees and embraces her, she allows herself to cry.
Large tears stream down the little girl's cheeks.
Holding her close, SOMEONE cradles her head in his hand as she sobs into his shoulder.
He eases her back to look her in the eye.
Cupping her face in his hands, he wipes away her tears with his thumb.
He kisses her forehead three times then hugs her again.
Now a sunbeam shines on SOMEONE's face as she sleeps.
Waking, she takes in her surroundings.
As she sits up, we notice guns hanging on the wall behind her.
She gets out of bed, crosses to a window, and peers outside.
A rising sun crests the Chicago skyline.
An elevated train travels along a track below.

As he flips pages in his newspaper, Mama serves SOMEONE food.
Mama pauses and faces the table gravely.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze and turns over his paper.
He turns over SOMEONE's slip of paper.
It bears a drawing of Zena on the back.
Eating her breakfast, the little girl shakes her head.
She looks up at her uncle with a resolute gaze.
SOMEONE leans back in his chair and takes a deep breath through parted lips.
He stares at her then affects a casual gaze.
His brow furrowed, he plants his hands on the table
and shares a brief uneasy look with his mother.
Now SOMEONE leads SOMEONE up the steps to a school's entrance.
Later in a principal's office, an elegant woman with blonde curls opens a stuffed yellow envelope.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit facing her.
She presents a folded paper to the girl.
The principal stands.
She smiles down at the girl who coldly gets to her feet.
As SOMEONE leads her out, the principal sinks back down in her chair and lets out a nervous sigh. Outside.
Turning, he finds SOMEONE standing motionless.
He nods and glances around.
He thrusts SOMEONE's backpack at her, draws a huge handgun and opens fire on a passing car.
It swerves off the road and hits a fire hydrant, knocking it from it base.
As fearful bystanders scatter, SOMEONE angrily faces his niece.
He swipes off his fedora and glances coolly at his handiwork.
He crouches before the girl.
He snatches her backpack.
He holds out the gun and the backpack.
SOMEONE snatches the backpack from his grasp and slings it over her shoulder.
SOMEONE holsters his gun.
A police cruiser pulls up by the wrecked car. He straightens, takes out his fedora and beats it back into shape.
As he puts it back on.
SOMEONE turns his niece away by the shoulder.
Keeping his arm around her, he saunters off casually down the sidewalk.
Now as we peer across a sprawling suburb, words appear.
California, 15 years later.
In a parking lot, a cop brings lunch to his partner.
A red muscle car plows into their cruiser.
Its door opens and an empty vodka bottle tumbles to the pavement.
A slender woman in a slinky mini dress staggers out.
The cops accost her.
They bend her over her car's hood and cuff her.
She wears the orchid pendant.
Now the cops drag SOMEONE through a police station booking room.
She stumbles and one of her shoes slips off.
A portly desk sergeant looks up at her approach.
The cops sit her down in front of him.
She slumps over, her long black bangs covering her face.
One of the cops retrieves her shoe and hands it to the sergeant then nudges her up.
The sergeant looks through her purse.
She rests her head on the desk.
She tries to take some candy but he snatches it away.
She dry heaves.
As the cops haul her off, the sergeant sets her abandoned shoes on his desk.
Now a bus pulls up in an alley.
Men in US Marshall vests march into view.
A bald mustached SOMEONE leads a team escorting a hooded prisoner.
He grabs a thermos. Now at a cell.
A SOMEONE unhoods a hatchet faced man with wild black hair.
The prisoner starts to enter the cell then pauses.
He takes gum from his mouth and sticks it on Warren's badge.
The SOMEONE smiles.
He leaves the gum on a crossbar then shuts the door.
He leaves the coffee thermos with the young SOMEONE.
Now a heavyset female guard brings a mug with a spoon in it to a cell where SOMEONE snores on a cot.
The guard leaves the mug on a crossbar.
As she leaves, the cell block lights blink out.
SOMEONE promptly sits up.
Reaching into her shaggy black locks, she pulls out a small hairpin.
Next she removes her wig, gathers her real hair at the back of her head and ties it in a bun.
From beneath her skirt, she rolls down a pair of black leggings.
She stands up, peels off the dress,
removes her bra, and pulls up a stretchy top attached to the leggings.
Kneeling to the cell door, she picks the lock with her hairpin then tucks it back into her bun.
She stands up, slides the cell door open and eyes a surveillance camera posted in a corner.
In a security room, a guard reads a newspaper, ignorning several monitors set up before him.
Back in the cell block, SOMEONE pivots the camera.
At his station, the guard turns on a portable radio.
He sets it by a monitor showing a view of a shadowy wall, then obliviously picks up his newspaper again.
In the female cell block, SOMEONE takes the spoon from the mug.
She presses a red button on the wall.
She slowly opens a door, slips out and shuts it behind her.
Creeping stealthily down a hallway, she reaches a break area.
She pads across the floor to a water cooler and fills a clear plastic cup.
Bubbles gurgle up into the water tank.
SOMEONE cautiously scans her surroundings as she backs away, then faces a door labeled Electrical Room.
She slips in and opens a cabinet revealing circuit breakers.
She sets the water on top then climbs a table and opens an air duct on the ceiling.
Next, she returns to the cabinet and balances the spoon in the circuit breaker.
She bites a tiny hole in the water cup
then sets it above the spoon.
Eyeing her wristwatch, she pushes a button.
She shuts the cabinet,
climbs into the air duct, and pulls up the vent cover.
From a hole in the cup, a drop of water escapes.
It lands in the spoon which dips slightly.
SOMEONE crawls through the air duct as more water weighs down the spoon.
Reaching a grated cover, she peers down at a male prisoner asleep in his cell.
As she crawls on by, he wakes.
SOMEONE reaches a large ventilation fan and checks her watch.
The spoon falls and the water shorts out the fan.
At his desk, the sergeant looks up.
In the air duct, the fan slows to a stop.
SOMEONE lies on her back and slithers her feet between the blades.
Below, Doyle shuffles into the electrical room and eyes the circuit cabinet.
A red light glows on its door.
In the duct, SOMEONE slides her chest between the blades then squeezes her arms down her to side.
Doyle opens the cabinet as she works her shoulders through the fan.
He flips a reset switch.
SOMEONE emerges safely on the other side just as the fan whirs back to life.
The policeman finds the plastic cup and shakes his head at it.
As SOMEONE crawls onward, Doyle chucks the cup in the trash.
Now the intruder lowers a ceiling vent hatch and stealthily climbs out.
In the secure cell block, SOMEONE finds his coffee thermos empty.
He checks on SOMEONE.
Finding the prisoner asleep, he shuffles to the cell block door and pushes a button.
He wakes the guard in the security room.
He buzzes SOMEONE through.
Later in a men's room, the young SOMEONE sets the thermos on a sink and crosses to a urinal.
As he relieves himself, SOMEONE slips out of the stall and creeps up behind him.
She kicks him as he turns, knocking him out cold.
Now in the security room.
A monitor shows SOMEONE standing at the door to the secure cell block with his face hidden by his arshal's cap.
The guard buzzes him through.
As the door opens, the unconscious SOMEONE sinks to his knees then falls face down.
Crouched in the hallway, SOMEONE creeps in after him and gently pushes the door shut.
She takes SOMEONE's gun.
Checking the clip, she finds it fully loaded.
She stands, holding the weapon pointed at the floor, and moves to SOMEONE's cell.
The prisoner sleeps sprawled on the cot.
SOMEONE slides the door open and saunters in.
She leans over SOMEONE, pointing the gun at his chest.
Tilting her head, she nudges the barrel against his brow.
SOMEONE wakes with a start and sits up.
The hatchet faced criminal hastily opens his gaudy shirt.
In a corridor, SOMEONE and the desk sergeant halt in their tracks. Blood splatters the wall behind SOMEONE as he collapses.
SOMEONE leads the charge as cops converge on the cell block from all over the station.
As they enter the cell block, SOMEONE wakes with a gun in his hand.
He notices the weapon and stares. SOMEONE takes aim at him.
SOMEONE surrenders the gun and his fellow marshals restrain him.
SOMEONE's dead body bears an orchid design drawn on his chest underneath the word traitor.
SOMEONE leads his men through a sweep of the station.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE kicks open a grated vent cover leading her outside.
In the alley, officers run past the prison bus. Several stories above, SOMEONE climbs out of the duct and clings to the wall. The officers hurry up a set of emergency access stairs. SOMEONE stretches her leg up to a shoulder high ledge. As she climbs, the officers arrive on the rooftop.
She reaches the top ledge.
Her feet scramble up the brick wall, propelling her over.
Landing in a crouch, she spots the police across the rooftop.
She breaks into a sprint.
Crossing to the roof's edge, she leaps over and grabs onto a pipe just beneath the other side.
Her toes touch down on a slim ledge.
She starts to reach up but withdraws her hand as an officer arrives above her.
He sweeps his flashlight over the edge.
Flattening herself against the wall, SOMEONE evades his detection.
The cop leaves and she pulls herself up.
Her legs accidentally sweep tiny bits of mortar off the ledge.
The SOMEONE lands behind two cops in an alley who turn and look up.
SOMEONE pulls herself into an air duct as an officer comes over.
Back in the women's cell block, she kicks open a ceiling vent cover and lowers herself to the floor.
She hurries to her cell and shuts herself in.
The heavyset female officer arrives with SOMEONE Warren and his men.
He stops at SOMEONE's cell.
Back in her party girl disguise, she lies curled up on her cot.
SOMEONE Warren turns away and faces the desk sergeant.
He leads the local police out of the cell block.
SOMEONE's eyes open and she rolls over.
Now a middle aged man in a dark suit squints in the sunlight as he steps off a private jet.

She enters an employee locker room.
She opens a locker, and pulls out a purse and a travel bag.

SOMEONE goes to a table, and puts down her things.
She pulls off her hat then removes her flannel shirt,
revealing a loose fitting tank top.
Brushing back her long hair, she opens a brown paper bag.
She takes out a cup of noodles. She eats some with her hands as she crosses to a complex media console
where she turns on a set of security monitors.
Scanning the feeds, she plucks out some more noodles, tilts her head back, then drops some into her mouth.
She sets the cup down then claps her hands and raises her arms above her head.
The live young assassin swivels her hips with sensual grace as she dances her way into a living area.
To her right, a large square painting depicting a pink SOMEONE orchid at the center of a gold rimmed medallion stands propped against the wall.

A bright golden flash clouds our view.

She raises her arms letting him lift off her shirt. He sets it aside. With both hands, he brushes SOMEONE's hair away from her face,
then leans forward and places a gentle peck on her cheek.
As he sprinkles her with more kisses,
she nuzzles her head against his. The next morning, the stuffed alligator sits on a table in front of a tray holding glasses of orange juice,

With SOMEONE at the wheel, it smashes through a gate and out onto the street.
At twilight, the truck splashes through puddles as it progresses down a narrow uneven alley.

He arrives at a door and passes through.
Its stenciled lettering reads, "Stanley J. SOMEONE, Chief Land Surveyor."
SOMEONE sits in his chair.
She aims a gun.

then blasts out doors and windows.
A crystal chandelier crashes to the ground.
As the flames give way to a haze of smoke,
SOMEONE and SOMEONE's gunmen writhe.
Looking into the adjacent room, SOMEONE finds his boss unconscious on the floor.
He hurries over and starts to lift him.
The man stirs.
He stands.
With their weapons raised, four gunmen rush into a spacious garage.
Scurrying to a row of luxury cars, they climb into a Mercedes.

The gunman tosses it over and SOMEONE pulls its pin.
He lobs it into the other room where it lands beside the murdered gunman.
The explosion tears into the floor and churning fire surges through the crawl space.
SOMEONE watches from a safe distance as smoldering SOMEONE rains down.
In the hidden compartment, SOMEONE presses his ear to the panel
then takes out his cell and dials.
SOMEONE answers.
Stepping into the destroyed room, the beefy gunman fires down the hole in the floor
then jumps into the crawl space, his weapon still blasting.
More gunmen follow.
With the phone still to his ear, SOMEONE aims a handgun as he cautiously steps toward the hole.

He grabs its barrel and strikes her in the head, snatching it away as she stumbles.
He raises it and she grabs a glass off a shelf and hurls it at him.

She whips the towel at his hand and knocks the gun into the tub.
As she whips at him, he dodges
then grabs the towel's other end.

Spinning, she backhands him with one of the brushes.
He charges, grabbing her around the waist.
As she gets thrown against the wall, the brushes fall from her grasp.
She lands a punch, sending SOMEONE crumpling to the floor where he grabs the abandoned gun.
As he points it at SOMEONE, she quickly releases the weapon's magazine from its hand grip then yanks the slide from the barrel and stabs him in the neck with it.
His head droops.
SOMEONE withdraws her hand, trembling as she falls back in exhaustion.
She stares at the dead gangster.
The clip juts grotesquely from his neck.
A bloody nosed SOMEONE scoots back from him,
her body quivering with emotional sobs.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE shifts his panicked eyes, then opens the compartment's panel.
Back in the bathroom, SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE's phone.
SOMEONE races to the garage and gets into a van.
Spinning its wheel, he steers past the destroyed Mercedes
and squeezes between the armored truck and a wall, side swiping both on his way through.
He speeds out a door and onto a narrow road.
With a frantic look, he pulls onto the main road leading out of his estate, passes through the front gate and swerves onto a street.
The van fishtails, its spinning tires leaving a wake of churning dust.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE exits the mansion.
Turning a corner, SOMEONE finds the road blocked by a garbage truck.
He answers a phone on the van's dash.
Turning, SOMEONE sees her dogs in the back seat.
The dogs attack and blood splatters the phone.
A view from outside shows the van shaking.
Blinking her weary eyes, SOMEONE lowers her cell from her ear and sucks in an anguished breath.
A thin trickle of blood leads from one nostril
to the tip of her chin.
Warm sunlight washes over her face as she drops to her knees in the grass under a towering tree.
She bows her head.
Back in Chicago, SOMEONE sits with Agent SOMEONE in an office at the FBI.

At the FBI, Agent SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE.
SOMEONE takes his cell back and heads out of the room.
As he leaves, Agent SOMEONE bows his head.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE brushes a tear from her eye then slides on a pair of sunglasses.
Golden sunlight glows down on her as she turns away from the phone and dons a hat.
She strides toward a bus parked at the side of the road.
A woman sitting on a bench stares off with disinterested eyes as SOMEONE passes by then boards the bus.
Its door closes after her and the vehicle pulls into the road.
The bus trails billows of exhaust as it trundles into the distance.
The bare-chested soldier watches the students halt at the end of the SOMEONE. A live young woman with wavy, corn silk hair, sets her purse on the railing.
A boyish guy sits on the railings, sending her purse plunging into the water.
As SOMEONE jogs up the SOMEONE toward the beach, the soldier jumps off the railing and plummets 15 feet into the water. The blonde's jaw drops. Underwater, the soldier swims down along the SOMEONE's barnacled supports. The purse stirs in the current, on the SOMEONE strewn ocean floor. The soldier seizes it, then kicks off the bottom and shoots back to the surface.
The soldier swims toward the beach.
On the sand, SOMEONE kicks off his flip-flops, and trots into the water, meeting the soldier in the surf.
The soldier delivers it.
The smiling woman shakes her drenched bag.
SOMEONE ambles off.
SOMEONE halts and walks back toward them.
He grabs his surfboard.
As SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE, he accidentally bangs his board on the SOMEONE.
They head off side by side.
The setting sun casts long shadows over the sand.
Dear SOMEONE.
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE Porter, and SOMEONE Jenkins.
Now a date appears. Spring 2001.

SOMEONE and SOMEONE ramble toward the water.
They halt among tufted beach grass, and gaze up at the moon.
As he demonstrates, she copies him.

Later, SOMEONE whacks a striker bar against a magnesium strip key-chain, instantly igniting a small campfire.
Holding a hotdog on a stick, SOMEONE grins.
SOMEONE bashfully glances at the fire and turns away. Then faces SOMEONE.
She nods, beaming.

A pickup slows beside him. It's SOMEONE. SOMEONE ride shotgun.
He stumbles.
SOMEONE loads his board into the bed of the truck. Later they drive.
SOMEONE points at SOMEONE with a nod.
SOMEONE sways capriciously and tickles the men's necks. Now the truck stops before a modest home with a bushy tree in the front yard. SOMEONE climbs out.
SOMEONE heads off.
He carries his board toward the house.
Now, SOMEONE opens the front door and enters a room veiled in shadow.
In a study, a balding man wearing a single white glove examines a coin under a magnifying glass. SOMEONE lifts the edge of a window shade covering the room's French door, and peeks inside at his father.
The oblivious man's gaze remains locked on his coin.
SOMEONE lets go of the shade and walks away.
His father glances over his shoulder, then stares off glumly.
SOMEONE heads into his room.
Outside, laundry whips on a line in the wind.
In the kitchen.
SOMEONE's father purses his lips into a thoughtful frown, and digs in his pocket. He pulls out a set of keys and hands them to SOMEONE, who ambles toward the door.
Later, a sign on a shabby seaside building reads, Bowens Island Restaurant.
Loitering men spot SOMEONE and swap looks. A goateed guy speaks up.
SOMEONE inches over to him.
SOMEONE joins a puzzled SOMEONE a few steps ahead of him.
Later in the restaurant.
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE blankly, and offers a fleeting grin.
She smiles back.
At twilight, two men fish on the dock outside the restaurant. Back inside.
She smiles quizzically.
He munches some food. Eyes the rosy-cheeked young woman, then shyly bows his head.
SOMEONE locks her in his sudden sobered gaze.
Later, they stroll toward his front door.
They head inside.
SOMEONE's father looks up from his desk.
He stands to greet them.

He brings out more.
Now the SOMEONE family car pulls up in front of SOMEONE's house. Riding with SOMEONE, she beams.
SOMEONE chews his pursed lips. Leaning over, SOMEONE gives him a kiss on the cheek. Then gets out of the car.
SOMEONE grins at him and shuts the door. He happily gazes after her.
At the beach, SOMEONE paddles his surfboard out over the breaking waves. He crests one, then swims farther out.
Later, he paddles with a flow of a swelling wave, as its foaming crest reaches his board, he gets to his feet and surfs it until it breaks. Later, he sits straddling his board, gazing at the houses along the shore.
Later still, he paddles out past a stone jetty.
At her house, SOMEONE steps out on her screened-in porch, and gazes toward the beach.
Now she walks with SOMEONE, as he carries his board from the water.
They stroll toward her home.
Now they approach a partially constructed house.
Later, she leads him through the house's framework.
It starts to rain.
She leads him under a cluster of boards supported by a beam.
They stand close together.
She strokes his eyebrow.
Looking away, SOMEONE works his mouth.
SOMEONE shrugs.
SOMEONE rests his cheek against the side of the beam.
SOMEONE gazes tenderly at SOMEONE. He leans his face closer to her, and she smiles.
She lifts her chin and her nose brushes against his.
Opening her mouth, she kisses him hungrily.
SOMEONE drapes her arms around his neck, as they passionately make out. He lifts her up, and she wraps her legs around him. As SOMEONE lowers himself to the floor, she straddles his lap.
Now, as they walk down a sidewalk, SOMEONE clasps SOMEONE's hand to his chest. At the sun dappled construction site, SOMEONE arrives to find him working at the top of a ladder.
She stops, watching him appreciatively.
He spots her, and they share a warm smile.
Now, SOMEONE holds his surfboard, tucked under his arm as they trod into the ocean. Later a wet-suit clad SOMEONE, crouches low on the board as she awkwardly rides a wave.
Tumbling into the shallow water, she grins. From the shore, her female friend pouts beside SOMEONE, who sullenly watches the couple. Trying another wave, SOMEONE manages to stand briefly as SOMEONE cheers her on.
Now, she hugs his arm as they walk hand in hand past a cafe. At the SOMEONE house, the young couple enjoys a meal with SOMEONE's father.
Later, silhouetted by a dusky sky, SOMEONE frolics on the beach, playfully evading SOMEONE's grasp.
He finally catches her in his arms. Lifts her and spins. At the construction site, the couple adds a plywood board to a wall. She swats her hand in front of him, as he hammers it in place.
In a living room, SOMEONE sings and plays guitar for SOMEONE.
In a hallway, SOMEONE sneaks up on her as she shuts a door. He turns her to face him, and they share a tender kiss.
SOMEONE peeks around a corner.
As his father paces in the living room, SOMEONE carries his girlfriend upstairs. Now they tumble unto his bed.
Mr. SOMEONE slows, blinking.
He gives a startled turn, then stares off. His brow knitted.
Upstairs SOMEONE rolls off the bed, then scrambles to a closet and shuts herself in.
She pulls at the door knobs, but he yanks the doors open.
Pouncing at her side, he tickles her.
As our view drifts upward, his armed uniform obscures them from view.
Back in the living room, SOMEONE smiles as she plays the guitar.
Reclining beside her, SOMEONE beams appreciatively.
Now, tall reeds wave in a breeze as the young man hikes into view, and gazes ahead. On the beach, a small group plays volleyball amidst a boisterous party. Near a grill, SOMEONE pats SOMEONE's shoulder.
Another group sits around two young men playing acoustic guitars.
SOMEONE hangs back, pensively taking in the cheerful scene.
Turning, he spots a solitary figure sitting alone at the base of a grassy dune.
At the volleyball net, SOMEONE pauses. He watches his rival cross to the dune, then turns back to his game.
SOMEONE hikes along a grassy ridge towards SOMEONE, and sneaks down behind her. He playfully grabs her side, startling the live young beauty.
She smiles contentedly in his arms.
SOMEONE lowers her troubled gaze.
Pulling her closer, SOMEONE kisses her brow.
He rocks her in his arms.
Her lips creep into a faint smile, and he kisses her brow again.

Glaring lividly, SOMEONE smacks his arm. SOMEONE faces her briefly, then leaves. SOMEONE cups a hand over his nose.
SOMEONE crouches to him.
At dusk, SOMEONE hikes along a dirt road. His feature obscured by shadow. An SUV rounds a turn, pulls up beside him, and continues on.
Silhouetted against the gray sky, SOMEONE bows his head. His stride unbroken.
Daytime, SOMEONE stands on SOMEONE's porch, knocking on the screen door.
In the next yard, SOMEONE takes out the trash, sporting a black eye and a swollen nose.
SOMEONE approaches him.
SOMEONE shrugs his hand and steps forward.
Getting a look at his face, SOMEONE slows.
SOMEONE fishes a scrap of paper from the trash bin.
SOMEONE meets the kind man who hands him the paper with a pen.
SOMEONE nods, and steps away.
Now an oven door opens, revealing two pans of lasagna.
A pair of hands and oven mitts take them out and sets them on a stove. SOMEONE wanders into the kitchen.
SOMEONE shuffles into the dining room. His father closes the oven door, crosses to an island counter and watches him. The young man clears one of three place settings from the dining room table. Taking it into the kitchen, he sets the plate, place mat and glass on the island. His father looks on as he starts to put the silverware away.
SOMEONE puts the silverware back down.
As he steps away, Mr. SOMEONE methodically sets the silverware aside.
He picks up the plate in both hands. Sets it at a precise angle in a wooden case, and slides a glass door close in front of it.
Later, we watch through a doorway, as father and son eat at the dining room table. SOMEONE gazes off as he chews, then looks down at his plate.
His father picks at his food.
SOMEONE watches him with a concerned expression.
With a melancholy stare, Mr. SOMEONE scoops a large fork full of lasagna into his mouth and chews.
He turns, facing a window. SOMEONE follows his gaze to find SOMEONE's car pulling up outside. Standing, he leaves the table.

He caresses her corn silk hair.
He kisses her smooth forehead.
She warps her arms around him.
She gives him an envelope and he starts to open it.

She turns her face toward his and kisses him. In the house, Mr. SOMEONE looks up from his coins. A window shows SOMEONE's car pulling away.
SOMEONE gazes after her.
His image recedes as she drives away.
With glistening eyes, SOMEONE watches him through her rear-view mirror.
She tearfully looks away, and watches the road.
Now at a bus station.
He takes two bags from his father.
The young man boards a waiting bus.
Its long side window shows Mr. SOMEONE lingering on the spot, staring off as he stuffs his hands into his pockets. The bus pulls away.
On the bus, SOMEONE reads SOMEONE's letter.
Now amongst sleeping soldiers, SOMEONE reads by flashlight.
Daytime at an airfield.
The soldiers file off a plane in their camouflaged uniforms. Each carrying a duffel.
SOMEONE exits the aircraft, squinting in the sun and proceeds across the tarmac.
He eyes one of his peers.
The dark-haired soldier stares defeatedly.
Their mustached superior leaves. SOMEONE lowers his gaze. At dusk, the platoon crosses the airfield and climbs the boarding steps of a cargo plane. On board, SOMEONE writes a letter.
Now a helicopter descends. SOMEONE rides on board among the others.
He gazes at passing trees.
The soldiers hop out of the landed chopper, one by one. Now they enter a crude village where a calf drinks from ruts of sitting water.
He hands a letter to a pilot.
SOMEONE watches the helicopter take off.
Now multiple letters travel along four conveyor belts. One of them addressed to SOMEONE Curtis. Letters flip vertically through a machine. A bin of bundled letters slides down a track, and a postal worker sorts the letters into cubbies. On a college campus, a mailman takes a few letters from his satchel and places them into one of many PO boxes. From inside the PO box, we see SOMEONE take out her mail.
On finding SOMEONE's letter, she smiles.
She reads on her way to class. SOMEONE instructs African troops.

He retrieves a small case from a lower drawer.
Then takes out a coin, which he holds under a magnifying glass.
Flipping the nickel over, he reveals the back of a penny.
He glances around the desk, and finds another coin. SOMEONE smiles.
Riding in the bed of a transport truck, SOMEONE reads "What's the story?".
He stares off.
In a flashback, a boy receives a handful of change from an ice-cream vendor.
Leaving the van, the boy studies his change.
Young SOMEONE licks his ice-cream cone.
Later his dad's fingers rinse the peculiar coin under the faucet.
In the kitchen, a younger Mr. SOMEONE studies the coin and shakes his head.
He glances at the boy.
Now at a pawn shop.
SOMEONE brightens, his grin missing a couple baby teeth.
Mr. SOMEONE collects the coin and tugs his son away.
Mr. SOMEONE hurries down a sidewalk and briefly stops for SOMEONE to catch up.
In another store.
The clerk sets the coin on a square napkin. Bends down and digs under his counter to retrieve a pamphlet titled, The Four Thousand Dollar Mule.
Mr. SOMEONE looks at his son.
SOMEONE nods.
The clerk grins.
Now at another coin shop.

SOMEONE goes to a stereo in the living room.
His father looks up from a coin. Seen distantly through the doorway, SOMEONE leaves the stereo and walks out of sight.
His dad glances over his shoulder.
On campus, a passing student bumps into SOMEONE as she reads. At the bottom of a staircase, she reaches a walkway where frantic peers gather and talk on cellphones. A confused SOMEONE holds SOMEONE's letter with both hands as she observes the anxious activity.
As SOMEONE remains frozen, our view is sent to take in a bird's eye view of the chaos. Now wearing plain clothes, SOMEONE walks alone on a busy street in an eastern European town. A horse-drawn cart, a woman on a bicycle, and a man on a scooter crosses path. SOMEONE approaches a cafe, where pedestrians gather outside. Reaching the entrance, SOMEONE joins his dark-haired buddy to watch television news coverage. Black smoke billows from one of New York City's Twin Towers.
SOMEONE breathes heavily as he watches SOMEONE falling off the building.
Fade to black.
Now in a hanger, the soldier’s superior approaches.
SOMEONE packs.
SOMEONE's friend rises.
SOMEONE, the only one left seated, lowers his gaze.
Later in a conference room, he shakes hands with two soldiers then grabs his bag.
He eyes his dark-haired friend.
Now a gray cargo plane lands on an airstrip.
Inside a crowded airport, SOMEONE sees SOMEONE on the other side of a security gate.
She ducks under a dividing rope, and hurries around to the other side. SOMEONE notices her and beams. She runs to him and leaps into his arms.
As he spins her around, they kiss.
A heavy-set traveler eyes them as he takes off his belt.
Another man eyes them, holding out his arms for a guard.
Later while SOMEONE drives, SOMEONE raises her free hand to his lips. He rubs her hand with his chin, then she strokes the back of his head, fondle his ear, and caresses his cheek.

Behind him, the front door opens, and the couple enters.
SOMEONE walks off, then returns to the sitting room.
They follow him into the kitchen.
He takes out the pan.
Now Mr. SOMEONE sits in the back seat of SOMEONE's blue Volkswagen, as they drive away. On a country road, he nervously stares at the foiled wrapped meatloaf nestled in a cardboard box on his lap.
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE. Mr. SOMEONE squeezes his brow.
Grimacing, he grabs at the door. SOMEONE reaches back. The car stops and Mr. SOMEONE gets out. A disheartened SOMEONE remains in the passenger seat, and rests his elbow on the window sill.
Mr. SOMEONE slouches at the side of the road.
She touches his back, and he walks off.
He walks a few paces away, then halts and hunches forward, catching his breath.
Now at the SOMEONE house, they get out of the car.
Mr. SOMEONE goes to the front door.
His father pauses.
He enters the house.
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE, rolls his eyes, then returns to the car.
Later on the road.
SOMEONE meets her gaze.
They both stare ahead somberly.
Now SOMEONE's car pulls onto a private road.
A stylish brunette woman in a white dress, crosses the front porch of a colonial plantation home, and greets arriving guests as she passes.
She hugs SOMEONE.

She flinches and shifts away from him.
SOMEONE bows his head and faces her from the side.
She looks at him ascant, then faces him fully.
She grimaces, agonizing and SOMEONE lowers his gaze.
She storms past him and disappears down the front steps, leaving him alone on the porch. SOMEONE watches her go, then swallows hard and hangs his head.
Now as guests stroll around the Curtis' expansive grounds, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE siting alone on a bench overlooking a marsh. His pace slows as he draws closer.
He gazes out at the wetlands as he waits a few feet away.
SOMEONE clasps SOMEONE's head in her hands, then wraps her arms around his neck and pulls him into a tight embrace. She rests her chin on his shoulder as he holds her.
She meets his gaze, then draws his face closer and kisses his forehead.
Leading him by the hand, SOMEONE takes SOMEONE to her family's stables. Inside, she leans back against a wall as she unbuttons his dress shirt.
He caresses her hair, then lovingly kisses her.
Dim blue light outlines SOMEONE's corn silk hair.
SOMEONE nuzzles the top of her head, as he sweeps her long blonde locks behind her back.
She parts his shirt, and slips it off his shoulders. Then wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him hungrily.
As SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE's neck, she lowers her dress and presses her body against his.
Now, SOMEONE's toned upper body hovers above SOMEONE.
Propped up by his arms, as she pulls his undershirt over his head.
She then removes her bra.
He lowers himself on top of her, and meets her lips with a passionate kiss.
The muscles in his shoulders ripple as he and SOMEONE make love.
He kisses her shoulder, then trails his lips from the tip of her chin, down her neck, and gently caresses her hair.
He lies beside her, his arm reaching across her body, to stroke her corn silk tresses with his fingertips.
They kiss sweetly.
She stares distantly. Her hand clasping SOMEONE's smooth freckled shoulder.
With a wistful look, she closes her eyes.
A tear slides out.
Glistening in the light.
And rests at the corner of her eye.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold hands as they stroll outside the stable into the daylight.
SOMEONE carries her heels, and she wears his jacket over her dress.
A wider view shows warm sunlight glinting through Spanish moss on a tree, as the couple embraces in front of the stables.
Now wearing his fatigues, SOMEONE enters the airport with SOMEONE by his side.
He spots his father waiting at a security checkpoint.
As the couple draws closer, a grin crosses SOMEONE's face.

SOMEONE shares a quick look with SOMEONE, who turns away.
He faces his father.
They exchange smiles.
Mr. SOMEONE shifts his gaze uneasily.
SOMEONE extends his hand. With his eyes averted, Mr. SOMEONE shakes it.

Later in the hanger on base.
The captain observes his men.
Sitting on a crate, SOMEONE furrows his brow thoughtfully.
He rises and stands at attention, joining the rest of his team.
The captain nods.
As the captain heads off, our bird's eye view of his men swings down to watch them collect their belongings.
Now, an image of SOMEONE's address handwritten on an envelope, drifts into view.
In Afghanistan, SOMEONE patrols a bustling street.
He pauses to talk to a young boy.
In a close-up of SOMEONE's letter, we glimpse fragments of sentences.
Just not the same without you. Rises and sets for both of us, is what helps me survive day to day. Love SOMEONE.
In a college classroom SOMEONE writes thoughtfully.
A close-up shows her pen gracefully filling a page with elegant cursive.
Back in Afghanistan, a pallet drops from a plane, and a parachute opens above it.
Later, two soldiers approach the fallen crate. SOMEONE heads over and receives a mailbag.
At the army camp, he distributes letters to soldiers.
With a letter in his hand, SOMEONE sits on a cot.
Now, a close-up shows a smooth cursive signature. Always SOMEONE.

In Afghanistan, SOMEONE's dark-haired buddy, passes him with a mailbag.
SOMEONE hangs his head as the soldier walks away.
Now, SOMEONE cautiously glances around as he steps into a tent.
He finds a cellphone on a desk, and reaches for it. Sitting down, he dials, then lifts the phone to his ear.
Now dust billows as a bundled pallet parachutes to the ground. Later, a soldier opens a mailbag and searches its contents.
Now, SOMEONE's dark-haired buddy carries a letter in one hand, and the mailbag in the other, as he enters the fenced-in base camp.
Passing a group of soldiers playing football, he approaches other lounging on picnic tables outside a tent.

As SOMEONE retrieves his spilled letters, a soldier passes.
Now, flames dance inside a trash can.
SOMEONE tosses a stack of letters onto the fire. As he adds more from his box, his dark-haired buddy walks up.
Clenching his jaw, SOMEONE shakes his head, as he continues to toss letters into the flames. His friend eyes him.
SOMEONE dumps the remainder of the box into the trash can.
He heads off, leaving SOMEONE staring at the fire.
Later, a convoy of military vehicles trundles down a dirt road.
Dust churns from their wheels. A Humvee passes a man leading a camel and maneuvers unto a busier road.
SOMEONE rides inside.
A man runs in front of their Humvee with his arms raised over his head.
The Humvee stops, and the soldiers climb out with their guns drawn.
SOMEONE heads away.
SOMEONE's dark-haired friend joins him. With their guns at the ready, they creep around the parameter of a decrepit factory.
The captain gestures to the rest of the team. Meanwhile, SOMEONE and Noodles round the corner of a deteriorating cement wall. Noodles glances at SOMEONE.
A man on a balcony shoots Noodles. SOMEONE fires back, then talks into his radio.
He grabs Noodles by the vest and drags him out of harm’s way. Then inspects the soldier's chest.
SOMEONE extracts a bullet from Noodles' tactical vest.
As SOMEONE helps Noodles stand, four bullets rip through him.
SOMEONE falls back in slow motion.
Soldiers fire at his shooter, who collapses.
Kneeling beside SOMEONE, Noodles props him against a wall.
SOMEONE's vision blurs.
SOMEONE glances drowsily at Noodles.
He gently slaps SOMEONE's cheek.
Our view of the soldiers tilts upside down, then drifts to the ground.
Now pale light shines through Venetian blinds, as SOMEONE lies in a bed.
A hand adjusts the slats on the blinds and bright sunlight pours into the room.
SOMEONE's head shifts, and his hazy vision finds a nurse at his bedside.
She smiles down at the groggy soldier.

He finds his father hanging his trousers over a railing, then sitting down at an empty table in his shirt, jacket, and boxers. SOMEONE<Dylan> frowns. As Mr. SOMEONE<Harper> casually opens a menu, his son trudges over.
SOMEONE<Dylan> takes a heavy breath. Patrons at the nearby tables begin to stare. A man and woman trade a sober look. Standing frozen to the spot, SOMEONE<Dylan> narrows his eyes.

The members of the flash mob abruptly disburse as if they're just commuters going about their business.

In slow motion, SOMEONE twists his body and takes aim at the SUV with only the distant forest floor below him.
One of SOMEONE's bullets pierces the vehicle back tire, causing the SUV to tip on its side. SOMEONE looks back. As the SUV slides across the road, our view meets its roof.
Now an animated sequence.
In association with Imagination Abu Dhabi, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Now SOMEONE kneels before a contract.
He smashes a bottle with his fist.
He splatters the contract with blood.
Flames envelope his head.
Lights beam from his eyes.
In a flash, his fist breaks the bottle. SOMEONE wakes with a start.

SOMEONE meets her gaze and she rubs the back of his head.
She smiles then kisses his brow.
They drive away. Our view lurches backward in brief irregular bursts of fast motion as we watch a pair of black SUVs pull out and follow them.
Now SOMEONE perches in a crumbling pane-less window high above the ground.
He sips from his flask as lightning flashes in the stormy sky. In the converted garage, SOMEONE sits hunched at a cluttered table.
He clenches SOMEONE's photo in his trembling hands.
Now lightning flashes in the sky as SOMEONE drives. SOMEONE sleeps in the passenger seat. She changes the radio station and turns her tender gaze to SOMEONE. Reaching out, she strokes his cheek with her finger then ruffles his hair.
Three SUVs come up behind them.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE overturns a cart. SOMEONE wakes.
On the road, the lead SUV rear ends the silver hatchback. In the garage, SOMEONE lurches. The hatchback swerves and the SUV pulls up to side swipe it. SOMEONE topples a shelving unit.
The SUV runs the hatchback off the road and down a rugged slope. SOMEONE staggers across the floor. The SUV rams the hatchback against a wall. SOMEONE's back arches, his eyes two dark hollow pits. In his perch, SOMEONE puts a cigarette in his lips and strikes a match. The flame blazes at a horizontal angle.
SOMEONE turns then throws the match down. Now he runs towards SOMEONE's garage to find a blazing light moving within. As he approaches the side of the building, a flaming blast erupts from its door. SOMEONE staggers back, shielding his eyes. Recovering, he finds a trail of fire stretching along the ground to a point of light speeding up the road.
In a deserted lot, the SUVs surround the hatchback.
SOMEONE gets out in a glare of headlights, gun in hand. Shielding her face, she shoots blindly.
A male figure lunges out and beats her.
He forces her down as other thugs get out of their SUVs. SOMEONE's attacker holds her arms behind her back.
Their wavy haired leader steps close.
A thug beats at the car door.
As SOMEONE struggles, SOMEONE smirks and bends down.

SOMEONE crouches beside SOMEONE.
SOMEONE's head droops forward defeatedly.
SOMEONE stands, aims his revolver at her and cocks the hammer.
Nearby a goateed thug turns. SOMEONE looks up. Following their gaze, SOMEONE discovers a fiery blast erupting on a far wall.
From it, Ghost Rider's flaming motorcycle arcs through the air. It lands in the middle of the lot, filling our view as it spins to a halt. The heavyset thug staggers back fearfully. The others stand motionless, staring at the Rider's flaming skull.
A heavy black boot with burn marks steps off the footrest and grinds into the gravel.
The rider swings himself off of the monstrous vehicle. Flames glow within its engine and exhaust vents.
The rider's gloved fingers close around his heavy duty chain. Lightening casts a glow on the mustached thug as he holds his shotgun ready. The chain links glow and the rider turns his scorched flaming skull.
Staring, SOMEONE rolls unsteadily in the gravel. The rider's head cocks erratically. He raises his fist to his opposite shoulder, then lifts his other hand and at angle. SOMEONE's slack jawed gaze shifts of the otherworldly creature to his henchmen.
The goateed thug shoots, his bullets making glowing holes in the rider's scorched leather jacket. Turning, the creature slings his chain back, grazing SOMEONE's shoulder. He flings it around the thug and gives it a yank, incinerating him in a flash. Lowering his chain, the rider sways side to side, his head tilting to and fro. A smudge of smoking embers stands in place of the goateed henchman. The mustached thug eyes them fearfully, then faces the swaying demonic creature. The rider wheels around to face him. In a rapid series of erratic movements, the rider charges. He stops inches from the mustached thug and looms over him.
The rider lowers his bony jaw, his mouth a swirl of flames. He leans over his victim who trembles and sputters incoherently. Looking along, the heavyset thug drops his rifle and sinks to his knees. The riders jaws abruptly snap shut.
Staring, SOMEONE grabs his brutish henchmen's shoulder.
Ghost Rider grabs the mustached thug's face. The henchman's wide eyes reflect his ghastly flaming visage as the rider cocks his head appraisingly then leans in to peer more closely at the man. Nearby, a scratch on SOMEONE's cheek seeps blood. SOMEONE opens the rear hatch of his SUV, pulls out an enormous rifle and hands it off to his brutish henchman.
The mustached thug's features twist in a helpless sob. The rider keeps his head in a firm grip, staring relentlessly. Our vision doubles as the thug's eyes cross and he sinks down. Nearby, SOMEONE stirs. A drop of his blood falls from his cheek and hits a stone. The mustached thug incinerates and the rider turns. SOMEONE's eyes snap open.
The rider clasps his own hand and massages his palm. SOMEONE's eyes shift upward and his head rolls to follow them. Facing him, the rider breaks into a march. A thug steps in and shoots but the demonic creature incinerates him with shot. Beside SOMEONE, the heavyset thug scrambles back. The boy regards the rider calmly as it arrives before him.
Lying in the dirt, SOMEONE reaches out desperately.
SOMEONE and his brutish henchmen run out beside her, each armed with an enormous rifle. They both fire. The shots send the rider flying. He hits the side of an SUV, caving it in.
SOMEONE fires a grenade. It explodes on impact, destroying the SUV.
He joins SOMEONE and the heavyset thug.
The heavyset thug forces SOMEONE into the back of another SUV while SOMEONE gets in the front. As it pulls away, SOMEONE reaches out for it then slumps breathlessly.
Cut to black.
Now we gaze down on SOMEONE as he lies in a hospital bed. His brow knits painfully and he stirs awake.
SOMEONE looks around, notices an IV in his hand and lifts up his hospital gown.
Jagged pink scars mar his flesh. A pretty young nurse steps in through a ring of curtain.
He flops back on his pillow.
Eyeing him uneasily, the nurse leaves. SOMEONE notices his jacket draped over a chair near a cabinet of drugs and medical supplies. Now he opens the cabinet and rummages through the drugs. He takes two handfuls of pill bottles. Now fully dressed, he slips out of his room and hurries down the hall.
Ahead, two doctors try to stop SOMEONE from leaving.
He pauses, watching her. Leaving the doctors, she halts at the sight of him.
SOMEONE's eyes look her over then narrow his eyes.
With an uneasy gaze, she steps away.
SOMEONE clutches her wounded shoulder as she heads up a ramp.
SOMEONE stares after her, glances back over his shoulder and follows.
Now in a sunlit clearing, SOMEONE's SUV sits parked with the driver's door open.
The heavyset thug stands nearby as SOMEONE opens SOMEONE's door and yanks him out.
The boy lands on all fours in the dirt. SOMEONE steps away.
Now at a busy transit platform, a figure in a black suit, matching coat, and well-shined shoes steps off a train.
Carrying a briefcase, he pulls out a sleek cellphone, slides it open and answers it.
His back to us, the man stops at a newsstand.
The man turns, revealing a long pale face with aging features.
SOMEONE thrusts his cell at SOMEONE's ear.
The screen splits down the middle. On the left, we watch the mysterious man's moving lips.
On the right, the phone at SOMEONE's ear.
The boy slumps on his knees, his hand limp in his lap. His shoulders heave.
Leaning back, his jaw distends in a supernatural roar.
SOMEONE drops the phone and staggers back. SOMEONE collapses on the dirt.
SOMEONE picks up his phone and puts it to his ear.
The well-dressed man ends the call.
SOMEONE lowers the phone.
From above, we drift down toward the boy as a wind blows a drift of sand over the ground. Nearby, SOMEONE angrily kicks the SUV's door shut. SOMEONE lies motionless, his brow knitted as his breath comes in shallow gasps. Light fills our view.
At the hospital, SOMEONE's head lurches back.
Blinking confusedly, he gives it a shake.
Stepping outside, he pauses and massages his right palm.
SOMEONE looks around and glimpses SOMEONE hurrying alongside the building. He staggers down the steps, clutching his abdomen. Peeking around the corner, he finds SOMEONE moving through a parking lot with affected nonchalance. She pauses by a car, checking its doors. They don't budge. Moving on to the car beside it, she turns. SOMEONE darts back behind the wall.
SOMEONE moves on then pauses warily.
She jogs out of view.
SOMEONE staggers after her.
Stepping past an ambulance, he looks around. SOMEONE lunges, aiming a gun at him.
SOMEONE adjusts her stance and narrows her eyes.
Grabbing her wrist, he brings the gun to his head.
SOMEONE wrenches herself from his grasp. SOMEONE lowers his regretful gaze. The mother regards him disgustedly but makes no move to leave him.
SOMEONE shakes his head.
SOMEONE sighs tearfully.
He offers a kind nod. SOMEONE's gaze hardens and she swallows. SOMEONE tilts his head.
Now SOMEONE's motorcycle sits on a truck's flatbed.
He knocks back some pills.
At the wheel, SOMEONE faces him.
A flashback.
Light overwhelms our view. Back in the present.
The truck takes an exit. Now in stylized animation, we view SOMEONE and other satanic incarnations.
SOMEONE Springer ends the series.
A man on fire shakes hands with a human.
We focus on the clasped hands. Now in SOMEONE's SUV, SOMEONE sits with his eyes closed.
His eyes open and he turns.
SOMEONE shifts his indignant gaze.
Turning away, SOMEONE flops back against his seat.
His gaze calm, SOMEONE lunges forward between the seats and wrenches the steering wheel. SOMEONE swipes at the boy as the SUV swerves wildly then fishtails. SOMEONE fastens his seat belt then gives his abductor a smirk. The SUV hits a concrete barrier and flips over on its roof. Steam wafts from the upturned undercarriage. Inside, SOMEONE hangs upside down, his eyes half closed in a placid gaze.
He blinks and looks around.
His hand finds his seat belt buckle and pushes the release button.
SOMEONE tumbles down and wrestles his way past the heavyset thug.
As he crawls from the wrecked SUV, the thug grabs his ankle.
SOMEONE tugs himself free and runs away.
We spy flames spreading over the undercarriage as SOMEONE and his brutish henchman escape, leaving the heavyset thug stuck in his crushed doorway.
SOMEONE shakes loose of his grasp and follows SOMEONE.
SOMEONE runs under a bridge along a river.
SOMEONE and his henchman follow. A massive fireball erupts from the bridge as the SUV explodes. SOMEONE and SOMEONE both stare then continue the chase. The henchman leaps from a concrete barrier to the riverbank. SOMEONE jumps from a ridge. As he lands on slippery rocks, his ankle snaps.
SOMEONE arrives and hauls him up by his jacket.
Two campers look on.
He points at the mohawked camper's brightly painted van.
The henchman fixes a menacing glare on the camper.
Their carefree smiles fade as they notice his large gun.
Now SOMEONE rides shotgun and his henchman drives the hippy-dippy vehicle. He looks over his shoulder at SOMEONE who sits slumped and blindfolded on the floor. Covered in swirling day-glo patterns, the van sputters fumes as it travels up the road.
Now the flatbed truck speeds down a dark stretch of road. Inside, SOMEONE's closed eyes flutter. We glimpse Ghost Rider's skull.
SOMEONE wakes with a jolt. He massages his palm and eyes SOMEONE.
Now two bodyguards flank a man in a tacky suit as he heads up a winding stone stairway. Camera flashes erupt around him as he ends a call on his cellphone. He heads up another flight of stone steps to a crowded warehouse floor where two men face off on a round platform.
Chewing gum, SOMEONE twitches.
Below, a fighter faces a hog on a leash. In a back room, the tacky man addresses thugs counting cash.
"Count every dollar. I don't want these idiots robbing me. Everyone's robbing me. It makes my balls hurt."
Now as SOMEONE's associate lights a cigarette, SOMEONE approaches. Subtitles: "Hello, Vasil."
SOMEONE shoves him against a wall and SOMEONE holds up a knife.
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE's phone.
Cringing, SOMEONE shakes his head.
Part of his face becomes skeletal then morphs back.
SOMEONE shoves the cellphone in SOMEONE's mouth.
His eye transforms into an empty black socket.
He shakes his head and the socket reverts to human form.
SOMEONE grits his teeth in pain then eyes SOMEONE.
SOMEONE nods.
He slams SOMEONE against the wall.
Two thugs appear and SOMEONE hurls SOMEONE into them.
SOMEONE begins to change as he races through the warehouse's abandoned rooms. A thug charges and he shoves the man away, setting him on fire. With flames now dancing on his arms, SOMEONE rushes outside. He sees his motorcycle surrounded in billowing fire, waiting for him at the end of an alley. Now he rides alternately cringing and grinning crazily as his face morphs from his human form to the Ghost Rider and back again.
His nose and eyes take skull form and he blows fire from his nostrils. Cringing, he reverts to a human face. He struggles to remain composed. Half of his face morphs again. Flames lick his cheek and burst from his eye socket.
His motorcycle's billowing fire rises and engulfs him. Now in the quarry, our view sweeps down a hulking bucket chain excavator's giant cutting wheel. A caravan of SUVs drives under the machine's long truss boom followed by a pair of cargo trucks. As the last truck passes under, a man climbs a ladder to the excavator's control cab which sits just behind the cutting wheel. At the boom's opposite end, armed guards keep watch on a balcony on the excavator's base structure. The trucks pull into an area surrounded by towering stacks of shipping containers. A bearded man exits an SUV and his men carry out two military crates.
He hands one of his men the missile shoulder launcher.
He ignites a lighter.
He blows out its flame.
The bearded supplier turns to his guards.
He smiles disbelievingly at SOMEONE, now in a storage room.
He sits wearing a blindfold.
She pulls it off.
She cuts the restraints tying him to a support beam then helps him up.
As she supports him, the brutish henchman appears. She flips open her knife but he twists her around and dips her as if for a kiss then hurls her to the floor. He extended his gun's telescopic handle. SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a fearful glance.
All three of them lift their eyes skyward.
Outside, SOMEONE glances around. The brutish henchman frowns.
SOMEONE throws her knife at him but he catches it. As he turns to her with a smile, she shoots him.
Outside, SOMEONE smirks.
He beckons the bearded supplier who hurries over with the missile launcher. They move to the edge of the quarry.
A man hands the launching tube to SOMEONE. Lifting it onto his shoulder, the wavy haired criminal peers through its thermal sight and finds Ghost Rider's glowing image as he speeds along the cliff above the quarry. He fires and the missile arcs high into the air.
As Ghost Rider speeds down into the quarry, the missile dives at him and explodes.
A mushroom cloud of flames billows into the air.
The bearded supplier's grin fades. Following his gaze, SOMEONE finds Ghost Rider unharmed, standing at the explosion's outskirts.
He backs away.
As Ghost Rider advances on a line of guards, they fire their assault rifles. He whips his chain at three of them and they disintegrate into flames and ash. He whirls the chain above his head, then strikes another. Dropping his gun, a guard races away. Ghost Rider whips him in half. As another guard pulls the pin on a grenade, Ghost Rider whips him and the grenade drops. Ghost Rider stares at it.
The guards turn from the explosion's blinding light. As it fades, they see Ghost Rider's horizontal body rotating three feet above the ground. The men aim their guns. Ghost Rider looks at one who flinches. Now on his feet, Ghost Rider faces him.
The guard shoots into Ghost Rider's open mouth. The flaming skeleton waits as bullets fly in. The man lowers his gun and Ghost Rider's head slumps. He bellows a stream of flaming bullets at the guard.
SOMEONE shoulders the reloaded launcher.
Through its sight, he sees Ghost Rider approaching. As the flaming skeleton knocks him onto his back.
SOMEONE fires the launcher aimed right at him.
The missile drives him high into the sky. In midair, the missile extinguishes Ghost Rider's flames, then propels him to the ground.
A brilliant fire cloud billows high into the sky. Ghost Rider's smoldering hand reaches out of the fiery crater left behind.
Ghost Rider's gaze shifts from the excavator's giant wheel to the control cab on the boom. As guards shoot at him, the leather clad skeleton rises to his feet.
His skull charred and smoking. As shots pierce his chest, the bullet holes glow. He starts to climb the ladder to the control cab, then pauses and turns to SOMEONE who gawks. He resumes climbing while a mass of guards unleashes a barrage of bullets. Now inside the cab, Ghost Rider shoots flames from his skull, shattering the cab's windows.
Fire billows down the excavator's boom and bursts around its giant wheel.
Sitting in the control seat between two levers, he pulls one back and pushes the other forward.
The flaming boom swivels around.
Shifting the levers, he raises the wheel high into the air, then smashes it onto a watchtower. He lifts the flaming wheel again, then heaves both levers forward with a maniacal grin.
The wheel crashes down on a trailer. From a balcony, SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch with wide eyes as the wheel slams a truck and some shipping containers then grabs them with the toothy ridges along its perimeter. The spinning wheel catapults a piece of flaming metal into the sky.
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE away.
The bearded supplier readies a launcher then spots the wheel above him.
Ghost Rider shifts the levers and the wheel crashes down.
It crushes the supplier in a burst of flames which sends SOMEONE flying back. The wavy haired man stands, blood dripping from his mouth.
SOMEONE helps SOMEONE down a flight of stairs. SOMEONE draws a gun. As he aims it at them, Ghost Rider's chain wraps around his ankle. It yanks him off his feet then drags him to the flaming skeleton. Ghost Rider lifts him off the ground.
SOMEONE drives off with SOMEONE in the flatbed truck.
As SOMEONE struggles in Ghost Rider's grip, the flaming skeleton hurls him away then gazes into the distance. He heads off. In the truck, SOMEONE gives an alarmed look.
SOMEONE shoots him a fearful glance. In the rearview mirror, she sees Ghost Rider closing in on his motorcycle.
She looks over her shoulder at him but finds no one. As she turns back, she sees him beside her. He grabs her.
Pulling her out through the driver's side window, he dismounts his motorcycle and grips her by the arms. Nearby, the truck rolls to a stop. SOMEONE's feet dangle a few inches from the ground.
SOMEONE climbs out of the truck.
SOMEONE's eyes widen as the rider gazes into them.
He looks back at SOMEONE.
Under the boy's steady stare, he releases SOMEONE. As he heads toward SOMEONE, his flames briefly fade.
He stumbles back a few steps, then continues toward SOMEONE who holds his ground. The fire dancing around his skull dims in a billow of smoke and Ghost Rider staggers, swatting at it. He shakes himself out of the daze. With his gaze fixed on the boy, he trudges closer, stopping a few feet away as inky smoke swirls around him. SOMEONE watches the smoke ringed skeleton drop to one knee.
The flames on his skull subside and he holds his hands in front of his face as if to protect it. The smoke dissipates, leaving SOMEONE in a kneeling position. He glances around.
He lifts his gaze to a boy.
At a truck stop diner, SOMEONE sits alone at a booth with a frown, his eyes fixed on a nearby family.
He sees the father ruffle his son's hair.
Approaching from behind with a tray of food, SOMEONE stops and follows SOMEONE's gaze. He watches the father affectionately touch his son's head then glances back at SOMEONE.
Sitting across from him, he slides the tray over.
He glances at the family then reaches out and touches SOMEONE's hair. The boy recoils.
SOMEONE stares sullenly.
Tilting his head, SOMEONE scrutinizes him.
SOMEONE gives an impassive look.
SOMEONE quirks a smile. SOMEONE joins them.
Sitting beside SOMEONE, she wraps an arm around him and kisses his head.
She gives a critical look as she sees SOMEONE lift a water pitcher and drink from it.
He chugs obliviously.
He flashes a grin at them then resumes drinking.
He drinks some more and SOMEONE nods. SOMEONE glances at her.
He clears the inside of his cheek with his tongue, then takes another drink.
Now at the quarry, emergency workers tend to the destruction. SOMEONE lies unconscious under a cement slab. SOMEONE approaches.
Subtitles appear as he speaks.
His expression becomes flat and he stares out lifelessly.
Lowering himself to his knees, SOMEONE slides his hand between SOMEONE and the cement slab. He presses SOMEONE's chest and the dead man's eyes open.
His lips stutter.
The left side of SOMEONE's face becomes withered and wrinkled,
and blood vessels burst in his eye.
Splotches of sores appear on his skin.
SOMEONE's body trembles as his dark hair morphs to blonde.
He withdraws under the cement slab.
Grabbing the slab, SOMEONE lifts it.
He tosses it aside to expose SOMEONE who now has straight shoulder-length platinum hair and ashen skin.
The resurrected man scrambles on his hands and knees in the dirt then glances around. He rises to his feet and eyes his gloved hands.
SOMEONE tosses him a smoldering piece of wood.
It rots in SOMEONE's hand.
He stares at SOMEONE with a pleased gaze.
Glancing over his shoulder, SOMEONE sees an EMT standing at an ambulances open side door.
SOMEONE follows his lackey's gaze. As they stare, the EMT furrows his brow and takes a step back.
He shifts his perplexed eyes. As he turns around, darkness engulfs him. SOMEONE grabs his head.
He presses a hand to the man's face which becomes dark with rotting flesh.
Smiling, SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE's touch decays the EMT's body until it crumbles apart.
SOMEONE gazes steadily at his lackey.
Later, SOMEONE works on his bike as he and SOMEONE ride on the truck's flatbad.
SOMEONE shakes his head.
He jumps up to his feet.
As SOMEONE mimes urinating, SOMEONE imagines Ghost Rider shooting out a powerful stream of fire.
He pictures the skeleton nodding at him.
SOMEONE glances at the passing landscape, his face becoming somber. SOMEONE sits beside him.
He eyes the boy.
SOMEONE meets his gaze with a grave look.
He bows his head.
Riding a motorbike, SOMEONE catches up to them.
He pulls up to the driver's side window.
Grinning, he speeds ahead of the truck.
SOMEONE mimes firing her gun with her fingers.
Now the rear wheel of SOMEONE's motorcycle burns rubber as it races past the tow truck, trailing a billow of smoke.
It pulls up beside then passes SOMEONE who shakes his head at SOMEONE. The boy sits in front of SOMEONE on the gas tank with his legs draped over the handlebars.
SOMEONE sets a bent knee at the rear of his seat then straightens it, pushing his weight onto his back foot.
Popping a wheelie, they glide along on only the bike's rear wheel.
Watching from the truck, SOMEONE smiles. SOMEONE shifts his motorcycle onto only its front wheel.
As the bike comes to a full stop, its rear wheels stay up in the air for a moment then drops back to the ground.
The tow truck cruises past. Now SOMEONE's motorcycle catches up to SOMEONE again. Meanwhile, the hijacked ambulance glides down an otherwise vacant road through desert landscape.
Driving it, SOMEONE reaches into a lunch box on the seat beside him.
He pulls out a sandwich. It grows moldy and disintegrates at his gloved touch. Glancing into the lunch box, he takes out an apple and watches the bright green fruit turn grey and crumble.
He rubs his gloved fingers against each other cleaning the dust from them.
He finds a plastic wrapped Twinkie and examines it then gives it a squeeze.
The top of the wrapper pops open and the end of the spongy cream-filled yellow cake peeps out.
SOMEONE bites into the still fresh snack and chews thoughtfully.
He shoves half of the remaining sheathed Twinkie into his mouth, then bites down on the wrapper using his teeth to hold the cake in place. He slides the wrapper out. It's now empty plastic smeared with cream.
Later, in the desert, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE along a path between jutting cliffs and barren mountains with cave-like openings.
They approach towering rock formations that appear constructed into, creating buildings within their natural structures.
SOMEONE gazes around.
He sees some robed monks.
A group of monks greets them.
The one in front removes his hood revealing tattooed writing covering his face and bald scalp. He places a hand on SOMEONE's head.
SOMEONE's fingers caress the cross hanging around his neck.
The monk glances at SOMEONE who gives an awkward nod.
They embrace then switch sides and embrace again. SOMEONE notices more monks surrounding their group.
The tattoo faced monk shifts his intense gaze to SOMEONE who lifts his chin.
The monk twitches a tight smile.
SOMEONE turns to his companion.
He winks at SOMEONE.
He moves to SOMEONE's side.
SOMEONE gives an uncertain look as she and SOMEONE start off with the monks.
A monk reaches for him.
SOMEONE kneels in front of him.
He touches SOMEONE's cheek.
SOMEONE guides her dejected son away.
SOMEONE glances aside.
Now they walk through a vast wine cellar.
SOMEONE grabs a bottle from a table in the middle of a rotunda.
He takes a swig.
He looks heavenward.
Our view ascends to find an angel spreading its wings over the earth.
The angel's eyes bulge, glimpsing a barrage of images - war, money, riots, napalm, a seductive woman.
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE and grins. He leaves a wall of cubby holes stocked with wine.
Fire engulfs a winged skeleton.
SOMEONE lowers his troubled gaze.
SOMEONE grins then wraps his arm around his friend.
At a cubby hole, he takes out an ancient bottle of ruddy wine.
He kisses the bottle then looks at SOMEONE.
He walks off and SOMEONE gazes thoughtfully.
He puts the cross around his neck in SOMEONE's hand and looks him in the eyes.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze. SOMEONE grabs the possessed man's shoulder and they sit down.
Holding the cross, SOMEONE looks into the priests eyes.
Daylight shines down on them from a hole in the ceiling.
He wipes a tear from his eye.
SOMEONE turns to his bag and takes out a small loaf of bread.
He breaks it in half.
He puts one half back.
He breaks off a piece for SOMEONE.
SOMEONE takes it from him.
He takes a bite then shifts his gaze.
SOMEONE pats him on the shoulder.
Now SOMEONE wanders through a tunnel.
He reaches the end of the passage and a huge slab blocks him from turning back. He enters an empty room.
Our view whirls, glimpsing numerous passageways. SOMEONE looks up at the room's domed ceiling.
A brilliant light flashes then shines down on him. He collapses to his knees.
He rolls on his back, his eyes morphing into hollow sockets.
As he convulses, the image distorts.
As he grimaces, his memories move in reverse. His blood lifts from the contract and the broken bottle reforms.
As SOMEONE arched his back in pain, we see him as a flameless Ghost Rider falling through a white void.
He drops into the distance, his arms and legs flailing.
He shoots a seemingly endless length of chain from his mouth. As it pulls taut, it breaks from his skull with a fiery flash.
His skull emits a flow of smoke, distorting his bone structure.
Cut to black.
Now on the floor of the empty room, SOMEONE lies flat on his back with his eyes closed.
Our view draws near the side of his face.
He wakes with a start and rises to a crouch then looks at his gloved right hand, gives it a rub, and brightens.
He hurries through one of the passages.
He runs down another.
He reaches the mouth of a cavern.
He heads down a stairway carved into the stone.
The path leads him to bluff overlooking the region.
He shifts his gaze.
SOMEONE hurries off. He enters a vaulted hall.
He finds the monks detaining SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE.
A monk seizes his arm.
SOMEONE falls to his knees, his gloved hand trembling.
SOMEONE swipes at another monk with his free hand but the monk grabs his throat.
The tattoo faced monk addresses SOMEONE.
He runs the backs of his fingers down her cheek then jams his thumb just below her chin, knocking her unconscious. SOMEONE looks on.
"Take them away until the thing is done."
The monks drag SOMEONE and SOMEONE out.
The tattoo faced monk marches off.
Outside, the hooded monks stand in a circle.
Two more bring SOMEONE to the center and bend him over a rock.
The tattooed monk follows. A monk pulls back the nervous boy's collar. The others sway side to side.
The tattoo faced monk draws a sword and taps its long curved blade to the back of SOMEONE's neck.
With both hands, the executioner raises the sword overhead.
He finds himself surrounded by darkness, then twirls his sword defensively.
As another monk gropes in the dark, SOMEONE grabs him from behind, rip him and lets him fall.
He runs to another and throws him down.
The tattoo faced monk spots SOMEONE leaping from his victim. SOMEONE snaps a decaying monk's neck. He grabs another from behind. The tattoo faced monk swings his sword. SOMEONE catches his wrist then vanishes. As the tattoo faced monk looks for him, SOMEONE grabs the swords hilt, causing its blade to rust and crumble. The monk grabs SOMEONE's throat and he collapses to his knees, waving his hands in surrender.
The monk lets go, his hand decomposing.
SOMEONE smashes the monk's hand, grabs his jaw, then slams him onto his back. Sneering at his victim, he holds two fingers over the monk's tattooed face. The monk's bald head withers, his skin crumpling. As he rots completely, SOMEONE holds up his two fingers.
In the light of day, SOMEONE watches SOMEONE jump back from his kill. He glances at the surrounding bodies of the other monks, each petrified in frightful poses. The boy steps back nervously.
SOMEONE eyes him, stroking his platinum hair.
Now as we rove over the craggy landscape, glaring sunlight overtakes our view.
Then shrinks to a pinpoint as we drift among two petrified monks left permanently kneeling in prayer.
As a butterfly lands on a sprouting mushroom, the image focuses on a moss ridden monk.
Crouching over one of the dead, SOMEONE picks up his cross necklace. She looks at SOMEONE.
SOMEONE joins them.
He heads off.
SOMEONE shifts her worried gaze. SOMEONE nods for her to follow.
Now we soar over the ruins of the demolished structure overgrown with weeds. Uzak gokten, Turkey.
An ambulance pulls up to the archways of an ancient amphitheater's outer wall.
Black clad guards surround the building.
SOMEONE walks out followed by two of his masked men.
SOMEONE steps out of the ambulance and shuts the driver's door.
SOMEONE opens the ambulance's back door.
He pulls out SOMEONE, bound to a stretcher.
SOMEONE strolls over as his guards untie the boy.
SOMEONE eyes him.
SOMEONE's smile diminishes.
SOMEONE chuckles to himself.
Now SOMEONE leads SOMEONE and SOMEONE through a passage.
He brings them to a vast armory.
SOMEONE peers through a scope.
She takes the sniper rifle. In a corridor, SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE.
The boy gazes up at him.
SOMEONE envisions Ghost Rider urinating fire from left to right.
He doubles over.
He sits up straight and SOMEONE nods.
SOMEONE meets his devilish gaze.
SOMEONE faces forward.
SOMEONE nods for one of guards to bring him a small case.
He takes out a syringe then turns to his son.
As a guard restrains the boy, SOMEONE injects SOMEONE through the neck.
SOMEONE smiles as the child loses consciousness. He stands upright.
He returns the syringe to its case.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE follow SOMEONE, climbing to the top of an ancient structure
which overlooks the amphitheater in the surrounding ruins. SOMEONE peers through a binocular, spying on arriving guests. SOMEONE takes a knee.
They watch the guests convene outside.
At dusk above the darkened horizon, scattered clouds roll across the sky.
At night, spotlights illuminate the ancient amphitheater as SOMEONE's guards walk SOMEONE out on stage.
The guards leave the boy kneeling before the guests who sit in six uniform sections, all wearing black robes.
SOMEONE faces his acolytes then raises both arms, gesturing for them to rise from their seats.
SOMEONE lowers his arms and sets his maniacal gaze on SOMEONE who remains on his knees rocking side to side with his head down.
Meanwhile, the cross hairs of a night vision sniper scope move from one guard to the next.
SOMEONE lowers her worried gaze, sets down her rifle, and heads off.
As SOMEONE follows her, SOMEONE returns his gaze to the amphitheater and knocks on a rock wall.
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE out among the ruins.
He lays his hand on her shoulder and she meets his gaze, fidgeting anxiously.
SOMEONE faces her.
He rests his hand on her shoulder.
She glances down then heads off and he turns to watch her go.
Now a half moon shines in the night sky.
SOMEONE's black robed acolytes sway as they chant.
On stage, SOMEONE kneels a few feet away from SOMEONE,
both swaying in unison as though under a spell. We glimpse a few chanting mouths. Meanwhile, the sniper scope targets a guard.
He collapses.
Another goes down.
SOMEONE reloads and takes aim at a third.
She glances up from her green tinted night vision scope then spots four men in a brawl.
She glances up once more then recognizes SOMEONE and SOMEONE as they leave their fallen enemies behind.
Now SOMEONE leads SOMEONE past a wall. He peeks around a corner then crouches with his partner.
He takes a swig of 2000 year old wine.
He hands the bottle to SOMEONE who takes a sip as well.
SOMEONE hands it back.
SOMEONE kisses his friend on each cheek.
He grins.
He grabs his bag and leaves. SOMEONE heads off as well. Now SOMEONE reaches an entryway and chugs his wine.
Two guards trade a look.
He tosses the bottle and shoots them both down.
He kicks a guard.
He reloads then runs up a staircase.
Now SOMEONE darts furtively through a passage in the amphitheater.
He hurdles the low edge of a stone window and peers around a column.
He finds SOMEONE and SOMEONE swaying on their knees before the chanting acolytes.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE slump forward.
The boy raises his head, his eyes bloodshot with black irises.
SOMEONE opens his black bloodshot eyes. SOMEONE creeps closer and shakes his head wrathfully. SOMEONE's lips move.
SOMEONE chants as well. His acolytes tilt their eyes back.
Gazing down on the stage, we find a shadow extending from SOMEONE's body as if reaching for SOMEONE.
SOMEONE runs out in the stands.
He shoots down a guard.
SOMEONE turns and looks up, his eyes returning to normal. As he watches SOMEONE shooting his guards and acolytes, SOMEONE runs onto the stage and punches him out.
SOMEONE runs through the stands shooting more acolytes. He pauses, spreading his arms exultantly. SOMEONE reaches a gloved hand out to SOMEONE.
An unseen force halts it.
SOMEONE stares coldly at SOMEONE through blackened eyes. SOMEONE tries again to reach for him but stops, his neck crooking convulsively. In the stands, SOMEONE arrives and grabs SOMEONE's gun hand. His glove and weapon decay.
SOMEONE sits up.
With a swipe of his hand, he sends SOMEONE flying off the stage. He lands hard in a gravel pit below. In a ring of darkness, SOMEONE decays the priest's right arm in his grasp.
The right side of SOMEONE's head decomposes as he swings his left fist at the demon. SOMEONE catches it easily and forces it down.
SOMEONE sees them.
Darkness closes in around the priest as SOMEONE's grasp decomposes him.
His back arches as the demon snarls. His face a mess of rotten flesh, SOMEONE smashes his head against SOMEONE's. SOMEONE looks on as SOMEONE shakes the rot off his face and out of his hair and mouth.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch the acolytes surround SOMEONE who struggles to stand in the gravel pit.
SOMEONE's hand creeps over his shoulder bringing him back to his knees.
He brings the other hand around to his cheek and holds him by the head. As SOMEONE looks on with a bitter twisted scowl, SOMEONE draws a line of decay across SOMEONE's high forehead. The devil turns and his minion looks up. The acolytes somberly part to reveal SOMEONE walking toward SOMEONE and the weakened SOMEONE.
The demon wrenches his victim's head to face the boy then grins at SOMEONE.
The devil smiles eagerly.
The boy regards him with a knitted brow.
SOMEONE kneels on one knee with the other leg crooked out awkwardly. SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE gives a puzzled scowl.
SOMEONE returns his somber gaze to SOMEONE.
He looks back and forth between the boy and his evil father.
He remember smashing the bottle with his fist and the contract pages flipping by themselves. SOMEONE gives a defeated nod as he recalls signing the contract with his blood. He looks up at SOMEONE.
SOMEONE bares his gritted teeth. SOMEONE runs up to him, seizes him by the shoulders and spews a jet of fire at him.
SOMEONE releases his victim and staggers back, looking on. The flames jetting from SOMEONE's mouth engulf SOMEONE's face. The cursed man accepts the fire with a wide open mouth.
Falling back, SOMEONE lies motionless on the gravel.
On his feet, SOMEONE staggers around as black smoke plumes from his head. The surrounding acolytes recoil as he draws near, his face a swirl of flames. Staring slack jawed, SOMEONE darts away. As SOMEONE halts and doubles over, the acolytes surround him.
SOMEONE helps up SOMEONE.
At her post, SOMEONE turns to find SOMEONE's motorcycle erupting flames as the engine starts by itself.
In the gravel pit, the acolytes close in on SOMEONE. In the sky, a rising sun breaks over a rapid swirl of clouds. Ghost Rider rises, taking out the acolytes with a circular sweep of his red hot chain. All around the amphitheater, posted floodlights explode. Outside, SOMEONE loads a limp SOMEONE into an SUV. Armed men in full body armor rush to surrounding SUVs and trucks. SOMEONE's vehicle speeds away followed by the armed convoy. In the gravel pit, Ghost Rider jerks his head side to side.
He stares at his own gloved hands.
His skeleton head snaps to one side attentively and he marches off. In SOMEONE's SUV, SOMEONE's head slumps forward. His father regards him with a bitter scowl as he leads the convoy at high speed away from ruins. Meanwhile, Ghost Rider marches from the amphitheater to find his flaming motorcycle approaching. It skids to a half before and he climbs on.
The rider speeds off, his chopper trailing thick plumes of black smoke.
Now SOMEONE's convoy travels through a desert on an isolated two-lane highway.
Ghost Rider quickly gains on the trucks.
The rear driver spots him and swerves left, blocking his path. The rider deftly weaves around the truck. A gunman ahead fires rounds from a mounted cannon. They blast holes in the asphalt around the flaming motorcycle but fail to impede it. At the lead, SOMEONE spies the rider in his side mirror and snarls resentfully.
Ghost Rider pulls up beside a ruthless truck as its driver barks into a radio.
He leaps from his motorcycle onto to the driver's side of the cab and shrieks in his face. The driver flies from the truck, landing in the dirt. Ghost Rider leaps onto the driver's seat and takes the wheel. Flames erupt throughout the engine and blaze around the tires.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE drives after the convoy in a dusty SUV, her chin lowered in a determined stare. At the wheel of the flaming truck, the rider thrusts one hand out to the side and gives a taunting shriek. The cannon truck swerves before it, the shooter firing relentlessly. Ghost Rider rear ends it and it explodes. The SUV ahead of it spins out of control, threatening to cut off SOMEONE.
She weaves around it without breaking speed. From below, SOMEONE climbs up on her hood. Crouching playfully, he touches a fingertip to her windshield. A web-like network of cracks spreads across the glass. He drives his fist through the cracks, shattering the windshield. SOMEONE shields her face from the flying glass shards. Ahead, an SUV carrying gunmen pulls up beside Ghost Rider's truck. The flaming vehicle knocks it off the road. The rider turns. Behind him, SOMEONE reaches a hand toward SOMEONE.
Ghost Rider slings his chain. SOMEONE lurches. With a tug, the rider yanks him off SOMEONE's hood and onto the bed of his possessed truck. SOMEONE grabs the chains which start to rot in his grasp.
His smug grin vanishes. The rider tugs the chain, pulling him down and leaps over him. Recovering, SOMEONE grabs him from behind.
The rider elbows him then knocks him back.
His chain rises by itself, winding around the demon.
SOMEONE dances away from it and meets the rider in a grappling hold.
The mad angel leaps from the bed and together they fly through darkness. Twin lights flare below them.
They're SOMEONE's headlights. The grappling foes land on her SUV's hood. SOMEONE head butts the rider who punches him. The demon rolls over on top of him but the angel throws him into the air. As SOMEONE lands back on the hood, his foe flings him off. The rider peers toward the road, looking for his enemy. SOMEONE climbs up the SUVs rear and over the roof. The foes reconverge in a wrestling grasp on the hood. Shifting gears, SOMEONE accelerates and rear ends an SUV knocking it off the road. SOMEONE bends the rider over the side of the hood.
Darkness fills the sky and Ghost Rider's flames sputter weakly.
His flames reignite in a wild blaze as he lifts his skull. He seizes SOMEONE by the head and brings his face close, his jaw opening wide. His cocky smirk gone, SOMEONE stares fearfully through glistening bloodshot eyes. The rider's flames catch on his long stringy hair. The vengeful creature flings SOMEONE to the road where he decomposes instantly.
Ghost Rider's skull snaps around, catching sight of SOMEONE's SUV ahead. His flaming motorcycle pulls up alongside SOMEONE's vehicle then creeps ahead. The gypsy woman shifts gears and accelerates. Ghost Rider leaps from her hood, landing on his motorcycle. Its thick trails of black smoke obscure our view as we follow him up the highway. SOMEONE's side mirrors show Ghost Rider gaining.
As he draws closer, he slings his glowing chain forward. It lashes around the undercarriage's central rod. Ghost Rider gives his chain a tug.
SOMEONE lurches and the auto part flies past the rider.
The SUV swerves off the road then flips end over end.
It lands on its roof in a flaming wreck.
Ghost Rider pulls up beside it, dismounts from his motorcycle and marches toward the vehicle with a steady purposeful gait.
He finds SOMEONE crawling laboriously from the wreck.
His aging wounded vessel limp from the chest down, the devil drags himself across the sand.
Ghost Rider's gloved hand snatches him by the shoulder then hauls him to his feet.
SOMEONE's twisted features scowl bitterly as the rider shrieks in his face.
Ghost Rider throws him down then slings him skyward with a chain around his chest. SOMEONE hovers helplessly in his bonds high above the earth.
The rider snaps the chains, slinging the devil into the ground.
Our view zooms down the chain to a seemingly bottomless pit.
Following the chain, we find SOMEONE plunging into a sea of fire.
His limbs flailing, he steers helplessly as the flames eat away at his flesh.
The hell fires flare, their light overwhelming our view.
In the light of a high bright sun, Ghost Rider crosses his arms over his chest. He spreads them wide, lifting his palms and skeleton face exultingly toward the heavens. He sways side to side, his fleshless mouth working in a growing roar.
Ghost Rider doubles over then arches back triumphantly. He slumps forward and lingers in stillness.
He turns his head.
Several yards away, SOMEONE crests a ridge at dogged run.
She lurches to halt at the sight of Ghost Rider standing beside the overturned flaming SUV.
The creature's skull turns toward the wreckage. As SOMEONE watches, Ghost Rider circles the vehicle, looking down.
He halts.
He glances back toward SOMEONE and lowers his gaze again.
His gloved hands reach out uncertainly and he lowers out of view. SOMEONE wavers on her feet, her breath coming in ragged gasps. She steps forward as Ghost Rider stands, cradling SOMEONE's limp form in his arms.
Ghost Rider carries the boy to his mother.
SOMEONE staggers woefully as he nears then sinks to her knees.
The rider bends down, laying SOMEONE in her arms.
She tilts the boy's head back gently.
SOMEONE raises a skeletal hand enveloped in blue flames.
SOMEONE eyes him uncertainly.
SOMEONE extends his mystical burning skeletal hand toward SOMEONE.
SOMEONE crosses a protective arm over her son.
Reaching past it, SOMEONE caresses the boy's cheek.
SOMEONE wakes, his color returning.
SOMEONE smiles joyfully through his tears. SOMEONE and his mother face him.
SOMEONE lowers his chin and narrows his eyes.
On a nighttime highway,
a skeletal biker blazes with blue flame.
SOMEONE leads four men down the alley
The outside group charges past a donkey cart. In the warehouse, the others run away and take cover beside an exit.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE peers up through an awning and sees a figure dash past an open-air window in the tower.
A solider peeks out from the warehouse.
SOMEONE fires a few bursts at the fifth floor of the tower then sees the sniper's head.
SOMEONE looks on.
The warehouse and cross over to the alley.
They race past looters dismantling light fixtures.
A soldier stands guard at a corner as his teammates enter an unlit building.
Another soldier uses a mirror on the top of a closed thick metal door.
The soldiers put on protective gloves and masks.
Beams of light lead the way into a pitch black chamber. We catch glimpses of a dusty floor and machinery.
The soldiers' flashlights glow from underneath the muzzles of their rifles.
And holds out a device pointed toward the floor.
Another soldier's light beam travels up the camouflage of a teammate's uniform.
SOMEONE removes his mask as two men open a pair of tall doors, letting sunlight flood into the room. The chief scans a rusted metal girder and other SOMEONE littering the floor. His men inspect the room.
SOMEONE eyes stains on the girder.
One guy checks out a stack of crates.
Now outside, a soldier smokes a cigarette as he lounges near a Humvee.
At the other side of the vehicle.

Sign reading Baghdad
In big text. Now pedestrians in traffic crowd as
Pots drops a bottle drop on him.
There's a parked car sitting blocking the road.
Now we soar over the city's crowded buildings to an area lush with vegetation. As we reach a palatial building, words appear - Coalition Provisional Authority
Dom's Republican Palace. Inside, Clark addresses high ranking soldiers and officials in a video conference.
A staffer shifts her uncomfortable gaze from SOMEONE to Clark.
Clark coldly shuffles his paperwork.
Now in a quiet residential neighborhood, an Iraqi man in a taupe suit patrols the sidewalk with an assault rifle.
Guard at an intersection. A fourth keeps lookout from a building's rooftop. A white SUV charges up the street then breaks by the man in the taupe suit. Nearby, a thin balding Iraqi with a mustache beneath his aquiline nose limps to a dusty grey car. Glancing across the street, he spots the guards escorting a cluster of well-dressed men away from the white SUV. The bystander gets in his dusty car, keeping an eye on the group as General SOMEONE leads them through a gate. Staring with parted lips, the bystander discreetly drives away. Inside a crowded living room, a middle-aged man lights a cigarette. SOMEONE enters the home and his host extends a hand.
They kiss cheeks and SOMEONE joins the other men in the living room.
They get to their feet. An older bald gentleman respectfully kisses SOMEONE's cheeks.
Another older man offers him the same greeting. SOMEONE accepts it then holds his hands up in a polite refusal to others as they edge toward him. The general sits and the others follow suit.

Focusing intently on the screen, SOMEONE reads an article entitled, News Source Confirms Iraq WMD Program. As his eyes scan the text, he takes note of specific phrases. A high ranking Iraqi official code named Magellan gave compelling information about Iraq's WMD program. Magellan identified specific site locations.

Leaving his men behind, SOMEONE strides out into the street and heads for the bus station. Scanning his desolate surroundings, he passes an abandoned hatchback.
Back at the alley, SOMEONE peeks around the corner and watches the chief pass a tall boxy bus. SOMEONE glances at it then arrives at the two-story cement ticketing kiosk.

The bus pulls away, leaving the bench inside the quaint shelter empty.
He jogs up a corridor then kicks open a coal door and slides down a spiraling chute.
At the bottom, he runs past damp brick walls then scurries through a labyrinth of pipes and machinery.
He ducks through a large gear with thick spokes then races up a spiral staircase.
Turning down another narrow hallway with steam rising through the grating, the boy reaches another clock powered by a complex mechanism of spinning gears.
He peers through the clock's open numbers at a toy shop below. Surrounded by dolls, rocking horses, musical instruments, and other items, a bearded white-haired man sits behind the counter with his chin propped on one hand.
The man glances sideways and narrows his eyes as he studies the clock.
The boy stares back through the number four.
The man releases a wind-up mouse, watches it scoot across the counter,
then retrieves it.
A brown-haired girl wearing a beret steps up beside the man and sets down a loaf of bread.
He gestures towards the back of the shop.
The girl stands and smiles at the man. Looking at her, he shrugs then nods emphatically.
Slowly, she turns and walks away with the bread. The boy watches as the man lowers his head and shuts his eyes.
His hands rest on the counter, a few inches from the wind-up mouse. Crouching, the boy leaves the clock and scuttles along a crawlspace beneath the walkway.
He swings open a small metal grate then steps into a tiled corridor, opposite the shop.
Confiserie et Juet, or candy and toy shop.
Wearing a tattered coat, shorts, and sweater, the boy creeps toward the store.
The white-haired man dozes behind the counter. As the boy reaches the toy shop, he reaches one hand toward the wind-up mouse.
The man suddenly snatches his arm.
The mouse falls and breaks.
The boy reaches into his coat pocket then sets items onto the counter: a pocketknife, bundle of string, and a piece of cloth filled with small sprockets, gears, and springs.
The boy glances over his shoulder then reaches into his other pocket. Glaring at the man, he takes out a small notebook and slaps it onto the counter.
The man releases the boy's arm then opens the notebook.
He frowns as he flips through the pages.
Handwritten notes, mathematical equations, and schematic drawings fill the pages.
The man inhales sharply as he flips to drawings of a mechanical man's head and torso.
The shopkeeper squeezes his eyes shut. As he rapidly flips the pages, the drawings become an animation of the automaton turning its head.
The man shakes the notebook in the boy's face then frowns and slaps it onto the counter.
Across the station, the station inspector lifts his head.
The station inspector removes the leash from his dog, who then runs off. The inspector limps through the crowd after him.
The dog skids across the polished floor as he runs up the hallway opposite the toyshop. The boy spins around then takes off into the crowd.
Swinging out his unbending left leg as he runs, the inspector follows after them.
He slams into a woman, spins, then falls on top of her. The five-piece band plays in the cafe as the boy leaps over a bench and upsets a dining table.
The boy zips through the cafe, then weaves his way through tables out front.
A woman clutches a small little dog to her chest as the Doberman skids past a large tiered cake, races past the band, then runs out of the other side of the cafe. The station inspector dashes into the cafe.
Hurtling toward the cake, the inspector turns and crashes into the band. He puts his foot through a bass guitar and falls into the band members. The inspector struggles to his feet.
Gripping a SOMEONE club, the inspector runs out the other end of the cafe.
Up ahead, the boy dashes through the crowd then slides under a newspaper vendor's legs.
The inspector shoves past the man, then pushes his way into a throng of travelers standing on a train platform.
He limps up the platform along the edge of the tracks, pushing people out of the way as he goes.
The inspector reaches the end of the platform and gazes around himself.
His dog paces in a circle. Above them, the boy paces along a narrow catwalk, running across the tracks as a train leaves the station.
The inspector throws down his club.
The passing train snags the inspector's leg brace.
He falls and the train drags him along the platform.
He slides into a suitcase, which strikes him in the crotch. The dog lies down and lowers his head. Meanwhile, the boy jogs up a grimy corridor filled with gears and steaming pipes. He crawls through a gap in a mesh screen then hops through the spokes of a large gear as it spins. The boy turns down a hallway then opens a metal door.
He peeks inside.
Reaching into a pocket, the boy takes out a set of keys as he approaches another metal door.
He slides a latch then shoves open the heavy door.
The boy enters an attic with a wood-plank floor and shuts the door behind him.
Light shines in through narrow windows along the slanted ceiling and illuminates spinning gears and exposed steel girders.
The boy crosses to a small area in front of three large windows which has been swept clean.
He steps to a worktable covered in gears, sprockets, and schematic drawings.
He picks up one gear and compares it to a drawing,
then tosses it aside.
Setting his jaw, the boy leaves.
He climbs down a metal ladder to a large square clock suspended over train station platforms.
Inside, the boy attaches a handle to the clockwork mechanism and cranks it.
He oils a gear then stares down at the crowd below.
Outside the cafe, the brown-haired woman still holds her little dog to her chest.
The news vendor - a rotund man wearing glasses and a beret - approaches the woman.
She nods and the man reaches his hand toward her dog.
The boy smiles.
Later, he trudges up a metal staircase inside a square tower. Clouds of steam rise up the lofty tower and drift past an enormous pendulum swinging back and forth.
At the top, large clocks face out from every side. Each controlled by a single mechanism with immense gears. Inching around some stray pigeons, the boy climbs a stepladder beside the mechanism and switches on a lightbulb hanging from a chain.
He cranks a thick handle protruding from the side of the mechanism.
Stopping his efforts, the boy gazes out the center of a clock face.

They approach a gate leading to a cemetery filled with snow dusted statues of hooded figures standing with their hands clasped and their heads bowed.
SOMEONE stares up at the statues as he passes.
The man walks out of a gate on the opposite side then enters a building's front door- which he shuts in SOMEONE's face.
SOMEONE furrows his brow.
He steps back and stares up at the building as a train passes along an elevated track nearby.
The girl who visited the shopkeeper earlier is visible in an upper window.
In the window beside it, the shopkeeper steps beside a curly-haired woman.

SOMEONE's father walks through the museum,
passing a sarcophagus adorned with the figure of a pope.
He steps slowly past marble statues and other works of antiquity and gazes at a pair of closed doors.

Moving with a stiff gait, he marches across the parking lot to his car. As he gets in, rain patters heavily against his windshield.
The wipers move in a slow rhythm against the downpour.
The water cast modeled shadows against SOMEONE's face as he steers off forlornly.
He sets SOMEONE's phone down, and takes out his own, and scrolls through the menu to check his messages.
His eyes welled with tears.
The next day at campaign headquarters, SOMEONE and the others watch a news report.
Now, as a figure sits on a bench facing the Ohio River,
SOMEONE's lanky frame steps into view.

As traffic moves across the nearby Roebling Bridge, Senator SOMEONE narrows his eyes and wets his lips.
SOMEONE regards him with a sober frown and nods.

SOMEONE stops and peers in through a window with open blinds on the inside.
He enters a front vestibule and steps into the dim establishment.
As he peers across the room, all but the lower quadrant of his face remains cast in shadow.
At the end of a long empty bar, a man stands in silhouette in the dark.
SOMEONE crosses the darkened room, passing a dozen unoccupied barstools.
He steps past the motionless Secret Service agent and heads through an illuminated doorway to a kitchen.
He crosses a well-lit section on his way to another darkened area.
Beyond stock shelves on a center counter, light shine under an industrial range hood.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze.
He ambles around the counter and finds the governor.
SOMEONE turns away.
He abruptly returns his gaze to the former staffer and the two maintain eye contact.

SOMEONE swallows his smirk. His expression hardens.
SOMEONE remains poker-faced.

In a barbershop, a seated a bibbed SOMEONE gets a haircut by a barber standing behind him.
Our view slowly roves around the side of the paunchy, middle-aged campaign manager
who gazes flatly from under his wrinkled brow.
Later, SOMEONE steps outside wearing his thick-rimmed glasses.
Beyond him, a black SUV idles just footsteps away.
Poking out of a nearby alley, another sits parked by the curb.
The campaign manager lights a cigarette then notices the SUV.
Taking a few drags, he heads down the sidewalk and approaches the vehicle in the alleyway.
A backseat window rolls down revealing SOMEONE inside.
The tinted window rolls up and SOMEONE manages a final pull on his cigarette.
He stubs it out on a wall and climbs into the SUV.
A head-on view of the black car gradually drifts toward the grill.
Its front tires rest in a buildup of icy gray slush on the alley apron.
To the left, exhaust blooms from the tailpipe of the second SUV.
The view keeps inching toward the nose of SOMEONE' vehicle until most of the second SUV falls out of view.
The forward moving trip ceases halfway across the street.
The backdoor opens.
SOMEONE steps out and shuts it behind him.

He approaches SOMEONE.
He heads off.
SOMEONE gets into his car. Now, SOMEONE stands at a podium with SOMEONE and his wife beside him.
The crowd of excited supporters wave American flags and hold signs. SOMEONE stands motionless toward the back.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE swap grins. SOMEONE whispers in his endorser's ears. They shake hands. Outside, a brunette young woman carries two trays of coffees.
The intern strides briskly with the delivery.
She marches past an information booth, enters the crowded hall, and brings SOMEONE one of the coffees.
SOMEONE nods.
SOMEONE gazes absently.
Now, the new campaign manager leads the way down a hall into a room marked "Morris Event Staff Only.”
Staff members sit at laptops facing three flat screens.
SOMEONE accepts his jacket from a colleague and puts it on.
As SOMEONE leaves, a TV shows an interview with SOMEONE.
The brunette intern faces SOMEONE. Outside, SOMEONE marches across a walkway and heads up the front steps of the campus building.
Later, he heads down an empty stairwell.
SOMEONE waits in a corridor. She follows SOMEONE down the hall toward a pair of imposing guards.
He dons his ID.
They share a knowing gaze, then SOMEONE files past one of the security guards.
Walking in our direction, he crosses a darkened corridor, his face cast in shadow.
An overhead light briefly reveals the young campaign manager's emotionless gaze.
As he continues his stride, another overhead offers a second glimpse of his plain look.
In a dim gymnasium, an empty canvass and wood director's chair awaits.
Beyond it, the lone campaign manager emerges as a blurry form from the corridor.
SOMEONE arrives at the makeshift set and takes a seat under a spotlight, illuminating a patch of the otherwise darkened gym floor.
A soundman outfits him with an earpiece while a makeup artist touches up his face.
The makeup artist leaves. As the soundman preps him for the interview, our view gradually orbits around the side of SOMEONE's face.
SOMEONE nods, gazing straight ahead with a deadpan expression.
As our view finally settles facing the young campaign manager, SOMEONE looks to his left.
He notices the blonde-haired makeup artist admiring him, then faces the camera and lowers his gaze.

SOMEONE looks directly at us.
She eyes her arm.
SOMEONE pauses on his way out.

SOMEONE takes the time with a smile.
Turning a corner, SOMEONE checks his body clock, then breaks into a run.
Arriving outside a factory, SOMEONE goes to a coffee cart with the drink prices listed digitally in minutes and seconds. The prices change abruptly.
SOMEONE sticks his wrist in a scanner that takes minutes off his timer.
Opening a flask, SOMEONE spikes his coffee.
Two men clasp each other's arms.
Now an inky black body clock shows all zeros on a dead man's arm.
A well-dressed man standing over the corpse meets their gaze.
As SOMEONE moves on, SOMEONE lingers, holding the thin man's gaze with narrowed eyes.
Later, he stands at a machine inside the factory.
SOMEONE sets a flat metal box on a platform, then pulls a lever.
As he repeats the process, a complete portable time capsule rolls down a conveyor sporting the curved receptor at one end.
It joins others in a bin.
Now, the factory workers file past a scanner. Each sticking their wrist in as they go.
Heading off, SOMEONE checks his clock.
SOMEONE marches out sullenly.
Now, he arrives at a harshly lit doorway where a sign overhead reads Beer/Wine.
He enters the bar where women in slinky dresses dance before a live band.
One paws at SOMEONE as he passes. Smiling politely, he sidles past and goes to a table where men play cards.
SOMEONE grasps the card player's forearm.

SOMEONE steps out of view as the man backs away.
The stranger bumps a table, then rushes nauseously into the back hall where he pushes his way in to a men's room.
Posted nearby, a thug in a fedora follows him.
Crouching at a toilet, the rich man vomits.
From hiding, SOMEONE swings a stall door, knocking out the thug.
Out front, SOMEONE spies SOMEONE hustling the rich man out.
In an alley.
SOMEONE blocks the exit with a dumpster.
He leads the wealthy man down the alley and out onto a street.
SOMEONE and his men leave the bar through the front exit and get in a waiting car.
The car pursues SOMEONE and the stranger down a deserted street.
The two men reach a gate.
SOMEONE boosts the stranger into climbing it.
Climbing after his companion, SOMEONE drops down on the other side as the car arrives.
As SOMEONE drags the stranger down an alley, the car backs out of view. The two men reach a door and SOMEONE breaks a chain locking it shut. The stranger starts to wander off.
SOMEONE yanks him through the doorway, then uses the chain to pull the door shut behind them.
The car speeds into view.
Hidden in a shadowy space, SOMEONE gets a firm grip on the chain. The gangsters get out of the car and bang against doorways spaced along the long wall.
Wielding a gun, the fedora-wearing thug marches up to SOMEONE's door and kicks the lock.

SOMEONE halts the transfer.
SOMEONE wakes with a start.
Getting his bearings, he habitually checks his body clock.
It reads over 116 years.
The working class man looks around, finds himself alone, and sits up.
Facing the windows, he stands abruptly and steps closer.
Letters written in the grime of a glass pane read:
"Don't waste my time."
Peering out a broken pane next to it, SOMEONE spots SOMEONE sitting on the railing of a high stone bridge, his feet dangling over the side.
The melancholy man faces the river and distant mountains as his body clock ticks down under 15 seconds.
He blinks his clear pale eyes in the bright morning sun and his woeful expression grows serene.
His clock ticks out its last three seconds.
SOMEONE's back arches and he grimaces painfully.

The bus pulls away.
SOMEONE's mother glances around, her eyes desperate,
then takes off down a desolate street.
Ahead of her, the bus's taillights glow in the shadows of dingy buildings.
Now, SOMEONE's mother furiously pumps her arms as she runs.
Behind her, a truck's headlights grow brighter as it draws closer.
She waves at the vehicle which speeds right past.
Finding only 20 minutes on her clock, she takes off at a sprint.
As the bus stops in Dayton, SOMEONE steps forward holding a bouquet.
Two passengers climb off and the doors closed behind them.

Meanwhile, his mother hurries toward a man entering a building.
He hurries inside and closes the door.
Banging on the door, she sees the man glance back then hurry off.
She checks her clock. Nine minutes.

Rounding a corner, she lifts her arm and finds her clock counting down from ten seconds.
She races faster.
SOMEONE sprints furiously toward his mother from the opposite end of the street.
As they draw closer, SOMEONE extends his hand. His mother beams. Three feet before they reach each other, she tumbles forward. He catches her.
Dropping to his knees, he cradles her limp body.
He finds her clock timed out.
His face contorts in anguish.
He presses it to her neck, rocking back and forth.
With his eyes squeezed shut, he tilts his face skyward.

awash with pale light from nearby buildings.
Two men in all black drag SOMEONE's body from the shallow stream of water in the otherwise dried up canal.

SOMEONE spots the surveillance camera on the bridge.
Now, a luxury sedan stops on a street in Dayton and SOMEONE strides over.
SOMEONE glances around, then slides up the sleeve of his charcoal suit jacket and the black dress shirt underneath, displaying the balance on his clock. The chauffeur nods and unlocks a back door.
With a cautious look, SOMEONE climbs in.
As the sedan glides away, he peers out his widow at the passing city.
The chauffeur shoots him a look in the rear view mirror.
SOMEONE blinks his sullen eyes.
The sedan reaches a booth labeled Time Zone 12 Border.
A concrete barricade blocks their path.
A metal panel cut in at one side to create a C shaped hollow flips up from a console beside SOMEONE.
He slips his wrist into the cuff-like scanner and watches his clock's balance count down.
A green light flashes on the booth
and the concrete barricade lowers into the ground, allowing the sedan to pass.
Later, the vehicle reaches one end of a bridge marked
Time Zone 8 Border.

SOMEONE eyes the dashboard admiringly.
At dusk.
The Roadster speeds along a winding road built into a cliff face as ocean waves crash below.
At night, the Roadster turns, pulls through an open gate, and passes a marble statue.
It pulls up to a vast opulent mansion with a column-framed entrance.
Just inside, SOMEONE stands with SOMEONE and two other auburn-haired beauties.

As SOMEONE and his hostage speed away, the timekeeper cars follow.
As their sirens sound, white bars of light repeatedly extend across their grills and upper windshields.
The Roadster turns out to a quiet road, forcing an arriving timekeeper car to veer to one side.

SOMEONE paces, then faces SOMEONE.
Brushing her hair back, he finds a sizable diamond stud on her earlobe.
He grabs her hand and leads her down the steps. They race down a deserted road and approach a building with a sign over the entrance reading simply Pawn.
Its metal security gate lowers.
SOMEONE sticks his foot under the gate.
SOMEONE's clock reads less than a minute. SOMEONE removes her earrings.
She tosses them under the gate.

On the street.

Meanwhile, in SOMEONE's study.
SOMEONE gives a nod and SOMEONE answers.
SOMEONE holds out the phone.
Taking it, SOMEONE casually leans against SOMEONE's desk.

Gazing at herself in a small mirror, she adjusts her straight auburn hair.
In the adjacent room, SOMEONE puts on a long-sleeved shirt.
Later, he gazes out a window at the Mission's neon sign.
Its status still reads Out of time.
He turns from the window as SOMEONE joins him in the living room.
SOMEONE drops her gaze to her outfit.
He sets the gun on a table, then pours the champagne from his mother's birthday.
SOMEONE sits on the edge of the couch.

As he rolls up his sleeve, SOMEONE puts her drink on the floor.
She gives him an uneasy look, then extends her arm.
They clasp each other's wrists.

A window seal displays bowling trophies and framed images of Jesus hang on a wall. Seated in the key maker’s workshop, SOMEONE<Steve> eats a pizza. An iPod on the desk plays next to the exposed police bug.

SOMEONE<Frazier> reaches the lobby and follows the first robber past empty desks and chairs. Holding his gun steady, the other robber tails the detective closely. They head through a set of glass doors to another staircase.
As the detective descends, SOMEONE<Dalton> reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pack of gum. He holds it out to SOMEONE<Frazier>.
SOMEONE<Dalton> approaches one of the side offices and turns back to SOMEONE<Frazier>. The mastermind opens the door revealing a group of hooded hostages seated on the floor. As the detective enters, the hostages look at him. Their faces masked only from the nose down. Walking past SOMEONE<Frazier>, SOMEONE<Dalton> heads to an interior door and turns the knob. More hostages sit in the next office.
All dressed in the same baggy coveralls, the men and women line the small office. While SOMEONE<Frazier> looks around, the mastermind opens a third door. The detective continues onward.

As SOMEONE<Frazier> picks up the receiver, SOMEONE<Darius> and SOMEONE<Mitchell> lean close.
On top of the truck, our view travels up a pole to a camera. The device rotates. On screen, SOMEONE<Dalton> and five unidentifiable witnesses surround a seventh person masked by a white sack. The mastermind shoots.
SOMEONE<shoots> exits the white sack and the hostage drops to the floor.

SOMEONE bends over and puts his hands into two gloves inside the suit. As he stands, the suit expands, covering SOMEONE's entire body. Small armored plates pop vertically out of the suit, then fold down to form a layer of protective metal. Other metal plates pop up from behind SOMEONE's neck, and cover his head, to form a red helmet and a silver mask with glowing eyes. With his foot, SOMEONE - or Iron Man - pushes the limousine yards away with one foot. Iron Man turns and raises his left hand toward SOMEONE. A glowing circle appears in Iron Man's hand. With his whip, SOMEONE slaps Iron Man's hand downward, then strikes Iron Man's suit. Iron Man lifts his right hand and fires two blasts at SOMEONE, who ducks.

She dabs ice cream on his forehead.
SOMEONE looks past her and stares.
He rushes across a busy street without her. Catching up, SOMEONE follows him through a gate flanked by gilded sculptures of Kung Fu warriors in action.
SOMEONE halts, staring, and so does she.
SOMEONE smiles. On a large rain-soaked courtyard stretching before them, 100s of students in identical crimson uniforms stand in tidy ranks.
At the instructor's command, they perform athletic moves with razor-sharp precision.
Their faces betray no sign of emotion as they pivot on their feet, kick, and crouch.
Beaming, SOMEONE rushes forward. His mother lags behind, her face awestruck.
SOMEONE strolls along the outdoor class' perimeter, watching the students.

Now, outside a sprawling ancient complex, a teacher speaks into a megaphone and leads a group of students.
Two huge, gleaming, red doors open, each studded from top to bottom with domed gold caps. Students flood through to a vast palatial courtyard.
Their teacher clutches a red flag in a raised hand.
As SOMEONE trudges through the gates, the only student not wearing his uniform, his eyes lock on the golden caps studding the doors.
At the back of the advancing group, SOMEONE pauses and turns around. She spots SOMEONE staring at the door and heads over.
With a smile, she stands beside him and joins him in craning her head back to take in the doors' full height.
SOMEONE glances at her. She places one of his hands on a golden cap.

As SOMEONE walks some distance behind the others, Mrs. Po stops beside him.
Mrs. Po kindly rests a hand on SOMEONE's back and ushers him toward the group.
Later, a student-filled bus passes the gate bordering Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. A framed image of Mao Zedong hangs above an arched entrance.

SOMEONE nervously lags behind on purpose.
Later, SOMEONE and the other boys walk through an arched gateway onto a narrow street.
SOMEONE follows at a safe distance.
The boys stop at a collection of parked bicycles and goof around. SOMEONE hides around the corner and watches.
He turns as a motorcycle cab trundles closer on a parallel course.
Using the cab as a moving shield to hide from the boys, SOMEONE walks at a crouch alongside it.
He nervously peers through a window as he passes the rowdy group undetected.
He scurries from the cab to a parked car and crouches behind it.
Across the street, a vendor shoos the unruly boys away and they move on.
Now, SOMEONE creeps beside the car, his eyes moving from window to window, watching SOMEONE and the boys pass.
He hurries behind another parked car and sees them halt on a stoop.
A few sit.
With a defeated look, SOMEONE squats behind the car and waits.
His eyes shift to a grimy steam vent on the side of a building.
Filthy water drips from it into a bucket.
SOMEONE glances over the car at the boys, then ducks as SOMEONE turns in his direction. On the stoop, SOMEONE demonstrates kung fu moves to his friends.
Dirty water splashes them. Gaping, SOMEONE glances around and spots SOMEONE racing down the street. He and his friends give chase.
SOMEONE sprints down the street, passing vendors with their carts. SOMEONE and his friends follow him across a road and into an alleyway. SOMEONE topples a stack of boxes, knocking them in front of his pursuers. Around a corner, men load items into the back of a truck. SOMEONE scales a pile of boxes beside them and climbs onto a roof.
Behind him, SOMEONE swiftly follows.
Half the boys acrobatically navigate the roof. The other half track SOMEONE from the alley. As SOMEONE touches back down to the street, SOMEONE's crew course after him through an alley filled with old tires. SOMEONE defensively tips over a stack of bottle-filled crates, but SOMEONE and his friends quickly surmount them. SOMEONE races through a set of double doors in a six-foot-high wall, then pulls them shut.
He finds a piece of wire hanging from a nearby hook and laces it through two eyelets on the doors, binding them together. As SOMEONE's crew struggle to open the doors, SOMEONE steps back and waits. SOMEONE leaps over the wall.
SOMEONE bolts and SOMEONE springs after him. Another boy leaps over the wall, then opens the doors for his friends. Following SOMEONE, the group races behind residential buildings, where drying clothes hang on lines. SOMEONE reaches the outer gate of his apartment complex, and races through its wide green doors, into a courtyard by the maintenance shed.
He halts as he notices the closed inner gate.
He glances around frantically, then hurries to the maintenance shed's doors and rattles them.
Turning from the locked shed, he sees SOMEONE and his cronies enter the courtyard.
SOMEONE tries to climb over the inner wall, but SOMEONE grabs him and throws him to the ground. SOMEONE hastily stands and backs away, as SOMEONE and two others close in on him.

As SOMEONE falls, one of the other boys attacks. Mr. SOMEONE deftly blocks every strike. Two boys' fists fly toward Mr. SOMEONE's face, and he bends backwards evading them.
Mr. SOMEONE waits in a fighting stance, his wrists crossed in an X shape.
He blocks a strike and holds a tall boy against his body. As a younger boy kicks, Mr. SOMEONE blocks the attack with the tall boy.
He pulls the young kicker in, uses him as a shield against the tall boy, then flips the younger into a trash barrel. SOMEONE and the others rush SOMEONE, who deflects their blows. He sends two slamming into each other, chest to chest, then bonks another flat with his own chest. He lifts one boy by his britches, and swings him in a circle, letting his sneakered feet whack another boy flat.
In a move like ballroom dancing, SOMEONE spins the controlled boy out, and the kid's loose-swinging arm slaps another boy in the face. Now, SOMEONE grips the boy's wrists in one hand, and draws back his fist to punch. The boy cringes.
As SOMEONE lowers his fist, an older boy attacks. Mr. SOMEONE absorbs, then redirects the strike into a boy's face. Now, as SOMEONE fends off several boys simultaneously, SOMEONE lifts his head and watches the fight.
Mr. SOMEONE grabs the arms of a boy in a warm-up jacket. He tangles a sleeve around the arm of another boy, and wraps the other sleeve around the jacket-wearer's neck.
He catches a third boy's leg in the sleeve, then guides his foot into SOMEONE's chest. He pushes the tangled boys to the ground. As he turns back to SOMEONE, a small boy steps toward him.
Mr. SOMEONE gives him a look and the boy backs away. His chest heaves as he turns from the group.

Shirtless, SOMEONE lies on a wicker couch and watches as Mr. SOMEONE holds a glass cup over the flaming cotton ball.

Now, Mr. SOMEONE and SOMEONE pass through the gates to the kung fu school, where the throngs of red-clad students hang out.
Inside the studio, two students spar while the others kneel around the edges of the platform. Their instructor sits on a bench and watches. Mr. SOMEONE scans his surroundings as he and SOMEONE enter.
One of the sparring boys throws his opponent to the mat.

We do not stop when our enemy is down. No mercy.

SOMEONE smiles as she watches her son leave.
Now, a man rides a bicycle down the street, the back of his bike piled high with plastic containers. On his skateboard, SOMEONE holds on to the container bouquet and catches a ride.
Down the road, he grabs the back of a bicycle-driven cart.

The children lock gazes from the wings, then meet behind the screen.
A spotlight shines on the screen from a lantern in a projection room.
SOMEONE holds a CD.
He hands her some sheet music and the CD. The cover shows a photo of SOMEONE on a hand-drawn background that reads, "Play along. Hope you enjoy."

She waves for him to follow her and steps into the storage room.
As she takes a seat on a bench beside the lantern, she points SOMEONE to a bench opposite.

The two young sweethearts lean toward each other into the beam of light from the lantern.
The spotlight silhouettes them as they move closer and touch foreheads, then press their lips together in a gentle steady kiss.
In the audience-packed house, SOMEONE's smile vanishes. She stares at the screen, slack-jawed, then disbelievingly cocks her head.
The spotlight projects the children's shadows onto the screen as they kiss.
A puppeteer lights a sparkler behind the kissing puppets, brightening their image within the shadow of the kissing youngsters.

Mr. SOMEONE dozes beside him.
SOMEONE shifts his puzzled gaze.
Mr. SOMEONE faces him wearily.
Leaning across SOMEONE, SOMEONE draws a character on the dusty window.
As he settles back into his seat, his student gazes solemnly at the character for chi.

Now on the station platform, Mr. SOMEONE leads SOMEONE off the train and hails a motorcycle taxi. Later, as it travels along a winding road overlooking the mountains, SOMEONE and his student ride on the rear-facing back seat.

Now, monks in snowy robes and canary-yellow scarves sit in lotus position, along the rim of a stone dam.
Water streams past them, down the glossy rocks.
Now, a jagged peak looms high above mountains patched with snow.
Our view tilts down to a dizzyingly long stairway beneath us.
Mr. SOMEONE marches up the narrow steps, followed by his student.
One section of the stairs rests on a fin of rock
barely wider than the stairway itself.
They ascend the steep run.
Later, at another section, SOMEONE stops, leaning against a stone banister.
Mr. SOMEONE continues up without breaking his stride. Now, we drift over an elaborate mountaintop monastery.
Rust-red walls support ancient rib-tiled roofs.
Mr. SOMEONE leads his pupil up onto a small balcony, then along a shadowy corridor.
It leads them into a stone courtyard where dozens of male and female monks, in snowy tunics, perform tai chi.
With fluid grace, they execute the meditative movements in perfect unison.
On a balcony, a man in a navy tunic rapidly twirls a fighting staff around his lithe frame. As Mr. SOMEONE leads SOMEONE past, the monk crouches on one foot,
balancing on his staff, as he extends his other leg, parallel to the ground.
Where two railings make a corner, a monk does a split from one to the other, and snaps open a large fan.
SOMEONE swallows, staring at the magnificent feat.
Venturing onward, the boy spies a third monk sitting in the lotus pose.
From a pair of twin platforms, he pushes himself up by his knuckles, and balances.
Now, an enclosed walkway stands built into a high cliff face. Mr. SOMEONE leads SOMEONE inside, glancing out the windows as he marches along.
Following his gaze, the boy halts in his tracks.
Outside, a woman in a white tunic faces the drop-off.
She crouches, revealing a cobra poised before her, its hood fanned out.
Slack-jawed, the boy runs to another window. The female ascetic stands on an ornamental-stone jut over the 1,000-foot drop. As she straightens, the reptile rises to match her.
Balancing on one foot, the woman sweeps an arm in an arc behind her head, and holds the other gently crooked before her.
The disciple tucks her extended leg in briefly, and folds her arms across her torso, then lifts her knee up to her chest, and extends her arms in a slanted T, pointing down at the serpent.
Her eyes wide, the woman slowly tilts her head, side to side,
her sharp-featured gaze fixed on the snake.
The cobra mirrors her, weaving left and right.
As SOMEONE stares at the spectacle, his head tips side to side as well.
Further down the corridor, Mr. SOMEONE stops.
Doubling back, he steps into the light as he finds his pupil entranced by the woman's practice.
He allows a faint smile and shifts his gaze.
The boy turns, wide-eyed. Mr. SOMEONE beckons with a wave of his hand.
SOMEONE gives one last look to the exquisite spectacle, then follows his teacher to a doorway.
SOMEONE removes his hat.
A basin stands paved with the Yin-Yang of black and white marble.
The basin stands upon a compass-like framework of white stone that's submerged in a shallow pool.
Mr. SOMEONE gazes reverently upon the well, then faces SOMEONE, and nods toward the water.
The boy solemnly steps up on one of the white-stone beams and approaches the basin.
The boy lays his hands on the rim. He plunges his face into the water. Mr. SOMEONE smiles as his pupil drinks eagerly.
SOMEONE lifts his dripping face.
He watches his teacher roaming the chamber wistfully.
He imitates the woman.
Mr. SOMEONE steps up on the latticework and joins his pupil at the basin.
He regards SOMEONE with a thoughtful nod, then points at the water.
SOMEONE ripples the water with his finger.
He points to SOMEONE's head and heart.
Now on a lakeside dock, SOMEONE attaches bamboo poles to SOMEONE's wrists by loops at their ends.
Mr. SOMEONE steps back, gripping a bamboo pole in each hand.
He moves SOMEONE's hand to his head.
He puppets the boy.
SOMEONE tips him over the dock's edge and holds him inches from the water.
Now, a train's headlights cut through the night air. In a passenger car, SOMEONE sleeps with his cheek on Mr. SOMEONE's shoulder.
As he stirs, his head flops down to his teacher's lap.
The man stares at the boy, then slowly rests a hand on his back.
He gives SOMEONE a gentle pat, then looks away, and takes a deep breath.
Now, Mr. SOMEONE puts SOMEONE to bed, as SOMEONE looks on.
The mother smiles at the man, then goes to her sleeping son.She kisses SOMEONE's forehead and caresses his cheek.
SOMEONE returns to the bedroom doorway, where Mr. SOMEONE looks on with a fond smile. The quickly closing door thins the shaft of light cast on the boy until it's gone.
Now, a child's drawing shows a coiled cobra with a fanned hood. A dotted line connects his eyes to the eyes of the slender woman striking a kung fu pose.
Sitting at a sunlit desk, SOMEONE hunches over a sketchbook and shades in the woman's hair. Now, he stares intensely at his mother, as they lunch in a marketplace.
SOMEONE frowns at her glowering son, then glances over her shoulder.
Later, he and SOMEONE bow, each signing a fist-to-palm gesture.
Now, SOMEONE limbers SOMEONE up, bending him over his knee, then pushing him into a full split. Next, SOMEONE works the water pump with precise arm movements. SOMEONE has a go, but struggles. Now, trying elevated push-ups, SOMEONE collapses. SOMEONE hangs a bell high above SOMEONE's head. The boy kicks at it unsuccessfully. On a roof, a hanging bed sheet separates them.
A boxing glove smacks him. The glove's attached to a pole.
SOMEONE peeks under the sheet.
The glove smacks him again.
He jabs SOMEONE's stomach.
In his courtyard, SOMEONE lobs tennis balls at SOMEONE. On the roof, he jabs again.
He gives another smack.
He jabs SOMEONE again, then steps around the sheet and faces him.
Now, SOMEONE holds a bamboo staff across his shoulders as he executes moves under SOMEONE's command.
In the rain, the teacher demonstrates a squatting leg sweep. In clear weather, he holds SOMEONE's ankles as the boy does handstand push-ups. The boy kicks at the bell with improved grace, but still misses. In his room, he poses at a mirror, and falls over.
Nighttime. In his living room, Mr. SOMEONE waxes the refinished car.
Pausing, Mr. SOMEONE faces the boy.
As SOMEONE leaves, Mr. SOMEONE slows his gaze pensive.
Now at school, the American boy turns down the brief corridor. At the other end, he spots SOMEONE standing outside the auditorium,
staring at a posting on the door. He joins her.
She leaves.
SOMEONE looks past her shoulder and freezes.
SOMEONE takes her by the wrist.
They run from the school, hand in hand. SOMEONE freezes, spotting a guard at the gate.
He leads SOMEONE around a pillar. He peeks around, signals for SOMEONE to be quiet, then leads her at a sprint down the sidewalk.
Now, they arrive at a vendor selling fried insects on sticks. A metal bowl writhes with live bugs and scorpions. SOMEONE selects a stick of fried scorpions, and thrusts it playfully in SOMEONE's face. She smirks as he recoils.
She chases him with it. From overhead, we watch numerous umbrellas part to make way for them. Now, they run among jetting-fountain plumes outside the Olympic Stadium. SOMEONE clutches SOMEONE's violin case as she chases him. Later, they gaze at the still water.
He disrupts it with his hand.
SOMEONE faces the water and blinks.
Now, the two hurry down a crowded escalator. In an arcade, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE to a digital dance game, faces its touch screen, and makes a selection from a list.
She leaves SOMEONE on the dancer's platform, claps her hands, and nods encouragingly.
Facing her, he performs a series of dexterous steps.
As he quivers his body side to side, he twirls his arms in front of his chest, then waggles his legs, making them look like rubber.
SOMEONE reluctantly steps up onto the platform.
She nervously faces the screen, putting her back to SOMEONE. She stands tensely, her shoulders hunched and her fists clenched at her sides. The girl looks over her shoulder, giving SOMEONE an anxious pleading look.
He lifts his brow, smiles, and nods. Words on the screen read, Get ready. SOMEONE nods to herself. She flings her hands out to the side, turns, and flips her hair. She struts toward SOMEONE, gives a shimmy, then pops her bent arms. Under his stunned gaze, she hops her feet out and in, and extends her arms to match. She gracefully shimmies her hips, steps away, then turns and points to SOMEONE.
He glances away briefly, his eyes wide. SOMEONE swirls an arm around her head, as she swivels her hips, then tosses her head side to side. Gliding across the platform, she sweeps a hand beneath her face. SOMEONE stares.
With a modest sigh, she steps down off the platform.
Later, they gaze out from a balcony.
SOMEONE digs out her cell phone. Answering it, she turns away.
She hurriedly ends the call.
Grabbing her violin case, she rushes off. Now, she runs along a sidewalk, with SOMEONE trailing close behind. Reaching a brick pillar, he stops at the sight of a stern man waiting by a black luxury sedan.
As SOMEONE dashes to the car, he gets behind the wheel. A lovely woman rides up front, wearing a worried gaze.
SOMEONE ducks behind the pillar as he watches the car leave.
Shifting his worried gaze, SOMEONE breaks into a run, and sprints down a tree-lined path.
In the school auditorium, a pre-teen boy plays the piano, his fingers moving nimbly over the keys. At the front of the house, a panel of judges watches him intently.
In the back, SOMEONE's instructor shifts anxiously on his feet. On a city street, SOMEONE sprints around pedestrians.
Back in the auditorium, the house lights blink on, and the judges make notes. On stage, members of a small orchestra tune up.
The judges turn as SOMEONE and her mother run in.
Her instructor urges the girl forward, then takes a seat near the back of the house.
SOMEONE arrives on the stage, kneels, and removes her violin from its case.
As her parents take seats near the front of the house, she steps center stage, bows first to the judges, then to the orchestra.
She raises her violin and bow.
One judge knits his brow, while another lowers his folded arms. Mrs. Po looks on with a softened gaze.
SOMEONE's instructor listens, stone-faced.
On stage, the girl plays with closed eyes and a furrowed brow.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE races doggedly down a sidewalk, dodging other pedestrians. He turns into the school gates and dashes through the entrance. Nearing the auditorium, he shoves past waiting young musicians.
Inside, as the instructor watches his pupil, SOMEONE's face pops up in the window behind him.
He sees SOMEONE playing on stage, and steps around the partition.
SOMEONE slips into a seat behind the instructor's shoulder.
SOMEONE stares tenderly.
As SOMEONE opens her eyes, the boy claps his hands earnestly.

As others shoot SOMEONE offended looks, he sheepishly trails off.

SOMEONE leans toward her instructor.
The instructor gets to his feet, walks past SOMEONE, and leaves the auditorium.
Craning his neck, the boy watches SOMEONE's parents proudly greet her.
She looks back at SOMEONE and holds up her pinky.
Beaming, he returns the gesture.
As they follow their daughter's gaze, the parents' smiles fade.
The father clasps his hands behind his back and addresses SOMEONE sternly.
Her joyful grin vanishes.
SOMEONE blinks quizzically at them.
SOMEONE's parents walk her up the aisle, stopping to face the young American boy.
SOMEONE stares at her, crestfallen.
SOMEONE unhappily bites her lip.
Her father pats her shoulder and they continue up the aisle as SOMEONE helplessly watches them go.
SOMEONE approaches, flanked by his friends.
SOMEONE shifts on his feet as they saunter past.
At dusk, SOMEONE shuffles through a teaming marketplace illuminated softly by lanterns in each kiosk.
He pauses and digs his cell phone from his pocket.
The message from his mom reads, Where are you? You need to get home.
SOMEONE pushes a button and the display reads, Message deleted.
Now, SOMEONE enters SOMEONE's house.
He slows, and looks around anxiously, then treads through the kitchen.
SOMEONE steps into the living room and finds SOMEONE bludgeoning the car with a sledgehammer.
The boy stares, slack-jawed, then notices a half-empty bottle of liquor sitting nearby.

The boy's confused gaze drifts.
SOMEONE paces to the driver-side door and plops down behind the wheel.
SOMEONE walks alongside the car, scanning the destroyed vehicle.
In a deep dent on the hood, he notices a newspaper clipping lying under pebbles of shattered glass.
SOMEONE leans closer, then picks the scrap up,
dumping off the glass bits.
The clipping shows photos of a smiling young woman and a pudgy-cheeked young boy.
a third photo shows a wrecked Scirocco,
its front end smashed and bumper hanging
SOMEONE regards the front end of SOMEONE's car and finds it similarly damaged.
The bumper lies on the floor beneath a cock-eyed headlight, and the sledgehammer stands leaning against the hood.

Following their guidance, the teacher climbs out of the car.
SOMEONE locks eyes with him and draws him forward, tears shining on his cheeks.
The car's single working headlight flares brightly into the courtyard,
silhouetting the pair, as SOMEONE tugs SOMEONE outside. They descend from SOMEONE's patio and move into the center of the courtyard.
The headlight projects their shadows onto the wall behind them, as the boy maneuvers them into position.
SOMEONE stares at him wearily.
Using both hands, SOMEONE angles a pole upward, raising SOMEONE's hand to his face.

SOMEONE puts the chalk down and resumes his seat.
SOMEONE leaves another chalkboard and resumes his seat.
On a walkway.
A librarian rushes with a book among a throng of students to a classroom.
Inside, SOMEONE fills the chalkboard with numbers.
Several more boards stand filled to his left and students call out each number he writes.
The librarian consults his book.
Back in the present.
The writer averts his eyes.
The writer shrugs good naturedly.
He helps his host bring food to a table and they sit down to lunch.
He graciously serves his guest.
In a flashback, two stylish blondes ride bicycles down a street.
They follow the charming, colorful street toward the sea.
Elsewhere, a beautiful woman teaches gardening.
Taking a disc of naan, he notices his host's eyes closed in prayer.
The writer sets down the bread.
She tells her sons the story.
The lovely woman snuggles on a bed with her two boys.
So Krishna opened his mouth.
She saw in Krishna's mouth the whole entire universe.
Young SOMEONE screws his mouth up thoughtfully.
Later in the dark, SOMEONE sits hunched beneath the sheet and uses a flashlight.
His brother sleeping beside him.
SOMEONE turns the pages of a comic book depicting the Krishna story.
A large panel illustrates a smiling Krishna holding his mouth open.
Beyond his lips swirl colorful galaxies, planets, and stars.
As we peer closely at the universe between Krishna's lips, it moves.
With the boy's father.
A barge carrying a depiction of Vishnu floats passed SOMEONE's mother.
Our view lifts up and away from the floating candles to the stars twinkling in the night's sky.
Our view spins, then descends to a sunny day in a lush valley.
Facing his sad-eyed, skinny brother, an adolescent SOMEONE points out a church at the rim of the misty valley.
It overlooks a tranquil river winding through verdant lands.
Now, as we peer out the church's open door.
SOMEONE leans into view with wide eyes.
He slips inside, then creeps to an alcove.
Scooping up water from a basin with his hand, he takes a few sips then turns and takes in the space with a curious reverent gaze.
Now SOMEONE stares across the pews at the alter where golden candlesticks surround a crucified Jesus statue.
His gaze drifts along a high row of paintings and fixates on one.
The priest approaches the boy and offers a glass of water.
Staring at the glass, SOMEONE cautiously accepts the drink and takes a tiny sip.
He glances at the priest then holds out a hand and regards the painting of Jesus being crucified.
Now young SOMEONE sits beside a glimmering river.
He stands and stumbles into the water. Now in the church.
SOMEONE removes his hand from a Vishnu figure and presses his palms together in Christian prayer.
He turns off a lamp and goes to bed.
Now young SOMEONE walks down a dirt road lined with grimy homes. Looking right, he sees dozens of kneeling men bowing, performing Salah in the mosque's courtyard.
SOMEONE watches from outside the gate, then slowly moves towards to courtyard congregation.
Speakers sit atop the mosque's tower.
Now at home, the young Indian performs Salah alone.
Later at the dinner table with his family.
SOMEONE crosses himself and prays as his family begins dining.
His father watches him.
Gita nods and swallows her food.
She touches her chest.
He glances between his sons.
SOMEONE nods gently at his father.
His beautiful mother eyes her family.
Slowly lifting his sheepish gaze, SOMEONE looks around the table.
His father stops eating and faces his wife who returns an amused smile.
In present day, SOMEONE and the writer leave his house.
At the zoo, young SOMEONE leads SOMEONE into a shadowy back room.
SOMEONE continues into a caged area.
He grabs handfuls of raw meat from a table.
He turns a wheel near a gate.
At the zoo.
SOMEONE crouches before the gate with SOMEONE kneeling behind.
A Bengal tiger steps beneath the lifted gate and enters the narrow corridor before them.
SOMEONE turns and runs but SOMEONE remains still.
Stopping near the end.
The beautiful animal stares at the boy.
SOMEONE extends a handful of meat between the bars.
SOMEONE glances at a gated off entrance to his side, then slowly stalks down the feeding corridor toward SOMEONE.
The young boy remains still as the tiger nears. Its long striped tail swaying behind.
Keeping his eyes fixed on SOMEONE Parker's, SOMEONE's hand trembles with the slab of meat.
The magnificent tiger stops a foot away.
His ears point backward as he extends his nose to the meat.
SOMEONE's father hurries inside.
The tiger bolts away.
Glaring, his father shakes his head and faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE runs off.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch a zoo keeper enter the room carrying a live goat.
He sets it before the feeding corridor.
Securing its rope leash to the bars, Selvam faces SOMEONE's father.
SOMEONE's mother enters.
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE crosses his arms and stares ahead as Selvam spins the metal wheel.
At the end of the corridor the tiger's gate slides open.
The family stands together facing the gate.
The alarmed goat shakes its head and ears, then spins in a circle.
SOMEONE slowly turns the corner and eyes the goat with his mouth hanging open.
Lowering his head, the intimidating beast stalks forward.
SOMEONE watches as he suddenly springs toward his prey.
SOMEONE winces and SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE against her as SOMEONE remains completely still.
With the goat now on the other side of the bars, SOMEONE pulls it back toward his cage.
With his head pressed to his mother's bosom.
SOMEONE watches the carnivore drag his kill.
Now in bed, teenage SOMEONE reads a Dostoyevsky novel as SOMEONE awakes to an alarm.
Later outside their school, young students rush passed SOMEONE through the rain.
Now SOMEONE sits on a beam below an ocean SOMEONE.
He reads L'Etranger by Albert Camus.
Now a round-faced teenage beauty dances with other girls wearing a vibrant red saari.
SOMEONE plays the dholak drum and watches her closely.
An older teacher sits crossed-legged and chants as teenage girls perform a lively dance. The round-faced girl spins rapidly, catching SOMEONE's gaze on several twirls.
SOMEONE glances at the teacher as the dance slows.
Keeping her hands on her hips, the round-faced beauty steps forward. SOMEONE stares at her with mesmerized eyes. His mouth hanging open slightly.
The teacher breaks his trance.
SOMEONE closes his lips and glances at SOMEONE.
She keeps her eyes cast down as her classmates smile.
Later in a bustling marketplace, SOMEONE spies on SOMEONE as she shops with friends.
A girl spots him and he quickly ducks behind colorful hanging items. As SOMEONE and her friends move on, SOMEONE attempts to follow them with the drum satchel draped over his shoulder.
He exits the market and stops, searching in both directions. Now SOMEONE scurries through a section of tall root-like banyan trees where SOMEONE awaits with her friends.
SOMEONE stares at the ground then forms a bowl with his hands.
She furrows her brow.
SOMEONE smiles and looks down.
He forms the bowl.
Surrounded by banyan trees, SOMEONE glances down then shows SOMEONE a warm smile.
Later at the zoo, SOMEONE and SOMEONE view the tiger lounge.
He faces them with his ears pointed back.
SOMEONE tilts her head and looks up.
A big smile spreads on SOMEONE's face and he glances between her and the tiger.
Later at the dinner table, SOMEONE stares off in a trance, smiling to himself as his father speaks.
SOMEONE shakes his head with a furrowed brow.
His mother looks down.
SOMEONE stares longingly at his mother who catches SOMEONE's humorless gaze. Later beneath the ocean SOMEONE, SOMEONE sits with SOMEONE as she ties pink string around his wrist.
The young beauty takes his hand.
Now on a freighter ship, SOMEONE leans on the rail of the main deck.
He gazes back at the brilliant sun setting beyond his homeland on the horizon.
He faces forward then looks back at the sun as his mother approaches.
SOMEONE stops beside her boy, following his gaze to the setting sun.
SOMEONE shifts his weight.
SOMEONE eyes her son then walks away.
Blinking rapidly, SOMEONE keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon.
Now in the eating quarters, SOMEONE faces a husky, larged-nosed cook.
The cook reaches behind the counter and puts a morsel of parsley on the plate.
She asked if you have something vegetarian.
The cook glances at the plate.
The cow that produced this liver was vegetarian, the pigs that went into these sausages were vegetarian.
Very funny but my wife doesn't eat liver.
The cook shrugs and grabs another plate.
Then she can eat the sausage, the rice and the gravy or you can cook your own food.
How dare you talk to my wife like that.
I cook for sailors not curry eaters.
SOMEONE grabs the cook.
The sailors pull SOMEONE away from the crazy-eyed cook.
Now the family sits with their eyes cast down as a teenage Asian boy joins them.
SOMEONE eyes the amiable boy and shakes his head with a smile.
Now below the deck, two orangutans sit in a four by four cage. The larger one takes the smaller one's hand and comforts it.
SOMEONE sits outside the cage, watching them closely and eating a banana.
His father dumps food in an ostrich pen as a camel and giraffe watch attentively.
Stacks of animal crates line the cargo hold.
SOMEONE stares at his son as he shoves pills into a banana.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze to the ship's floor.
Present day on a park bench.
The writer watches him with a furrowed brow as adult SOMEONE stares into the river before them.
The writer nods and grins.
Facing the river, he leans forward.
A map of the South Pacific fills the screen.
We zoom to the Mariana trench.
As we push through thick, churning storm clouds, deck lights illuminate a freighter in the night. Heavy rains pound on the swelling ocean.
Ramping off a wave, the ship's bow lands hard on the seething surface. Water bursts upwards as it skips to another wave.
Below deck, SOMEONE slowly awakes in his cabin bunk.
His eyes dart about. His parents sleep in a bed across the room.
He leans down to the bottom bunk and shakes his sleeping brother.
SOMEONE quickly pulls himself into his bunk as his mother rolls over.
The hands on a travel clock point to 1:17.
SOMEONE climbs a flight of stairs and enters a corridor.
The door swings shut behind him.
He staggers and steadies himself on a railing as he moves along.
Turning, he faces a door with a port hole.
SOMEONE peers through at the lightning flashing in the darkness.
He turns a latch and the door swings open. The wind and rain lash in at him.
Venturing out, SOMEONE leans over a railing and scans his tempestuous surroundings. As he steps along a walkway, his feet slide on the wet flooring.
He stumbles as the ship violently rocks and he catches himself on a banister.
SOMEONE climbs stairs to the neck deck and slides on his bare feet again.
He catches himself on a railing and clings to it as he beams down at the churning, roiling ocean.
Stepping back, he looks skyward and waves his arms giddily.
He struggles to perform a worshipful dance.
Getting to his feet, he notices a red light flashing from a high post. Falling again, SOMEONE slides into a barrier at the edge of the upper deck.
He braces himself and climbs to his feet. The ship plunges into a wave sending water crashing over him.
It leaves the upper deck flooded as he recovers.
SOMEONE watches two sailors moving frantically below with flashlights.
SOMEONE reaches for them futilely as they wash overboard.
Sobered, he races back inside.
He staggers through a corridor.
Finding his level flooded, he dives into the water and swims. He passes a panicking zebra.
SOMEONE surfaces.
Gasping then submerges himself and swims onward.
The teen passes through a dark section lit only by the pulsing red emergency lights.
Reaching a door at the end of the corridor, he struggles to open it.
It springs open releasing a powerful current of water and air bubbles.
SOMEONE hangs onto the door frame and tries futilely to pull himself into his family's quarters.
Releasing it, he drifts back down the corridor and returns to the deck.
An animal leaps passed him.
A bird seeks refuge in the nearby tower. Other animals struggle for footing on the rocking ship.
A sailor gives him a life jacket.
The Buddhist struggles to free a lifeboat carrying the cook.
The Buddhist leaps to SOMEONE.
The Buddhist, captain and the sailor shove him onto the boat. SOMEONE tumbles across the canvas cover and hangs off the edge. The cook signals to the men on the ship.
SOMEONE climbs back up and scrambles around as the others shout at him.
As SOMEONE clings to one set of lines, the cook unfastens another.
The Buddhist points as the zebra at the railing of an upper deck.
The boat tips and the cook falls off.
SOMEONE loses his grip on the lines and the lifeboat plummets to the sea.
SOMEONE lands on his belly and struggles to hold on as the boat bucks on the churning waters. SOMEONE slides backward, landing at a wave that buoys him back on the boat again.
It carries him past the shouting men at the edge of the ship's deck. A giant wave washes them from view.
The lifeboat carries SOMEONE through the wreckage. A boom sweeps low over his head.
Escaping the wreckage, the lifeboat briefly capsizes. As it rights itself, we find SOMEONE holding on tightly and the zebra lying inside. SOMEONE peers across the giant waves and locates the sinking ship. He notices a whistle on his life jacket and blows it.
He frantically waves his arm at the ship.
Peering into the seemingly endless expanse of rolling waves, SOMEONE spots a figure in the water.
Finding a life preserver, he climbs up on the canvas secured tautly over the front half of the boat. He casts the flotation device out into the water with all his might.
The lights of the capsizing ship twinkle and pulse in the distance as SOMEONE uses a line to reel in the drowning figure.
He slides a long handles oar out from beneath the canvas cover and extends it over the water toward the life preserver.
Two paws and a large furry head emerge from the center of the ring.
SOMEONE jabs futilely at the tiger with the oar. A wave carries the beast to the lifeboat's rim.
SOMEONE grabs on and climbs partially aboard. Scrambling to the prow, SOMEONE dives into the water. Getting his bearings, he looks back at the lifeboat, then gazes out over the roiling water. A giant wave looms stories high above him.
SOMEONE takes a deep breath and submerges. The wave briefly rolls him as it passes by.
Staying under, SOMEONE swims past a shark as he makes his way beyond the lifeboat.
Turning, he finds himself facing the completely submerged ship.
The teen halts and hovers in the water.
His limbs splayed as he stares at the enormous craft.
The deck lights glow as the ocean's depths claim the vessel.
SOMEONE looks on helplessly as the ship descends into the deep.
Turning away, he swims.
Two other sharks fight over a fresh kill beneath him. The tempestuous waters swirl over SOMEONE as he makes his way back to the surface.
The teen thrusts his head above water and gasps.
With long strokes, he swims back to the lifeboat.
SOMEONE grabs for a mast jutting five feet from the prow, but a passing wave compromises his reach.
Another carries him to the boat's rim.
SOMEONE climbs on to the deck with the zebra who lies curled up on its side on one end.
Knee-deep water sloshes around the deck.
SOMEONE climbs back on the canvas cover, then scrambles to the prow.
He leans far out, clinging to the mast.
A wave sends a blast of spray into his face.
Shaking his head, he catches his breath and peers down into the water.
Another blast of sea-spray drenches the teen.
He watches helplessly as the ship sinks further beneath the churning waves.
The ocean's rippling surface distorts SOMEONE's view of the lost vessel.
We drift up and away from the boy as the lifeboat carries him over the ship's watery grave.
A section at a time, the deck lights flicker then blink out.
Lightning flashes then diminishes leaving the boy alone in the darkness.
The next day a seemingly endless expanse of choppy waves roll beneath a low ceiling of storm clouds. The lifeboat bobs amidst the whitecaps.
With the life preserver looped over the prow beam, a huddled, shivering SOMEONE sits in the rain while clinging to the mast with his hands.
His feet brace against the front of the boat.
A shark passes beneath him.
Glancing down at it, SOMEONE struggles his way to the canvas covered bow and rolls over on top of the beam.
Lifting the edge of the canvas, he peers inside.
Water sloshes over the floor of the boat.
The water splashes the zebra who still lies curled up on the wooden bench-like seats rimming the far end.
One of its hind legs lies unnaturally straight as it drags its haunch along the bench.
Later, SOMEONE uses a bucket to bail water from the boat.
With weary, dogged motions, he scoops out one bucketful after another.
SOMEONE drops the bucket and collapses on the bench near the canvas cover's edge.
He leans back, his arms draped on the boat's rim and cover.
SOMEONE lifts his head.
A hyena emerges from the canvas shelter.
The hyena darts back under the canvas. As SOMEONE takes up a long handles oar and jumps to the canvas cover.
SOMEONE the hyena darts out. It leaps at SOMEONE clumsily and snaps at the oar. Its jaws clamp on the oars paddle.
SOMEONE drops the oar and retreats to the prow beam.
Clinging by his arms, he swings himself around so his legs dangle over the water.
Curling his abdominal muscles, he lifts his legs and fits them through the life preserver.
From his makeshift seat, he watches SOMEONE mid-boat as the hyena tries to climb up onto the canvas. The beast makes it only half way up, its hind legs staggering with the rocking of the boat.
The spotted hyena keeps its four paws on the canvas, staring at SOMEONE.
It turns its head. SOMEONE follows its gaze, peering across the surf.
From a cresting wave, an orangutan rises into view, perched on a floating bundle.
SOMEONE ducks into the canvas and the zebra stretches its neck toward the approaching ape.
As she draws near, we recognize her flotation device has bananas wrapped in netting.
SOMEONE extends an oar to her and she climbs aboard.
The teen gives her a weary smile then leans over the side of the boat.
In the water, the banana bundles float free of the netting.
SOMEONE gathers up the net.
Pulls out a stray banana and tosses it to Orange Juice.
The orangutan lets it bounce off her shoulder and land on the flooded floor of the boat.
Facing SOMEONE, she grimly works her lips and folds her long arms.
Frowning, the teen peers out over the sea.
As SOMEONE faces her with a concerned expression, the orangutan lowers her gaze and sighs. Turning her head over her shoulder, she gazes off over the water.
SOMEONE blinks understandingly.
SOMEONE settles wearily onto the canvas.
He gives a resigned sigh.
Now flies swarm around the injured zebra, a thin white foam covering its lips.
Standing on the canvas cover, SOMEONE turns.
He drops to all fours and picks up the bucket.
Lying on his belly, he slams it against the boat's hull.
The hyena emerges from beneath the canvas.
Rediscovering SOMEONE, it leaps at him.
The teen scrambles back and fends off SOMEONE with the oar.
The animal gnaws on its paddle.
Orange Juice scoots back on the bench and shrieks as SOMEONE bounds passed her and runs in circles. The hyena briefly leans over the edge the resumes its wild laps as SOMEONE stands ready with the oar.
SOMEONE stops at the center, his body convulsing. He vomits on the floor.
Licking his chops, he makes another try for SOMEONE but slumps weakly against the canvas.
The netting dangles from the base of the prow beam.
SOMEONE sits at the bow sharing a vigilant gaze with the hyena who remains back at the edge of the canvas.
The teen wavers wearily, his eyelids heavy.
Glancing over his shoulder.
SOMEONE bounds to the zebra and snaps at its injured hind leg.
The wounded animal kicks at the predator.
SOMEONE and Orange Juice watch helplessly as SOMEONE kills the zebra.
On a gently rolling current, SOMEONE sits in the makeshift seat at the boats prow, hugging the life preserver.
Dark circles shade his bleary eyes above his red, chapped cheeks.
SOMEONE's eyelids droop and he blinks himself awake.
The teen nods off again.
He falls back into the water, hanging by his knees from the life preserver.
Waking, he jolts up and gasps.
The sputtering teen manages to sit up and catch his breath.
A line of saliva streams from his mouth as he looks around and recovers.
In the boat, the zebra lies dead.
Orange Juice slumps against the edge of the canvas cover taking slow, deep breaths.
He lifts away a hatch beneath the canvas cover and finds a duffle inside. Opening it, he finds a red booklet titled, "Survival at Sea" lying atop an array of supplies.
SOMEONE takes it out and flips through pages illustrated with diagrams.
Lifting another hatch, the teen finds it packed with life jackets. He takes one out and tosses it to Orange Juice.
The orangutan picks it up, turning it in her hands and feet as she examines it.
Beyond her, SOMEONE digs out several more life jackets.
Orange Juice gives hers a shake, the throws it down.
Later, using ropes and netting, he bundles the life jackets together into a small, makeshift raft.
The life preserver crowns it and three long handled oars criss-cross out from it.
Forming six branch-like spokes.
As SOMEONE struggles to maneuver it into the water,
SOMEONE emerges from the canvas shelter.
Perching atop the zebra's carcass, he starts to take a bite. Orange Juice angrily thumps the rim of the boat.
SOMEONE turns and stalks the orangutan who backs against the canvas' edge.
As SOMEONE lunges, she strikes him down.
As SOMEONE looks on, his jubilant smile fades.
Orange Juice peers down at the hyena, then sits on steadily and faces her human companion.
SOMEONE attacks her.
He drags her down to the floor and tears into her.
SOMEONE climbs over his raft and unsheathes a knife.
The hyena retreats to the boat's stern and cowers.
Our view sweeps down to Orange Juice's body as it grows still.
Blood stains the wood near her throat.
As he stares down at her, SOMEONE's mournful expression hardens wrathfully.
Facing SOMEONE, he swings the knife.
The tiger springs out from the shelter beneath him. Landing on the zebra, SOMEONE kills the hyena with a wrench of his jaws. Behind him, SOMEONE scrambles for his makeshift raft. As he pushes it overboard, the tiger faces him with a snarl.
Standing, SOMEONE picks up the oar.
SOMEONE swats it from his grasp.
As the tiger climbs onto the canvas, SOMEONE curls up in a fetal position with his back to him and squeezes his eyes shut.
SOMEONE backs off, returning his attention to his kill.
SOMEONE leaps from the boat, following a rope, tethering the raft to the lifeboat.
He tries to climb on top of the raft but it rolls under his weight.
Later, the boy persists as the bundle of life jackets loosens and rolls beneath his grasp.
He strikes it angrily.
Later still, he ties the life jacket to the end of an oar spoke, balancing the raft's buoyancy.
A shark swims passed as he works, spotting it.
The boy climbs on top of the raft.
Now SOMEONE lies still beneath the canvas shelter.
At the boat's prow, SOMEONE peaks in at the tiger, he lifts out the duffle of supplies, revealing a sizable stock of canned goods and boxed food beneath.
SOMEONE eagerly climbs in to retrieve them.
Now, perched at the prow of the lifeboat, SOMEONE drinks down the contents of a can.
He fits a plastic lid on top, then drops it into a sack nestled at the center of his makeshift raft.
SOMEONE takes a handful of cans from the supply hatch and drops those in as well.
Taking out small boxes, he chucks one in and opens the other.
Unwrapping a nutritional biscuit, he takes a big bite.
Looking down, he finds a sizable rat scurrying over the cans.
SOMEONE watches it as he eats.
SOMEONE lunges at him.
The tiger halts, his claws sticking in the canvas.
He staggers back, snapping irritably at the fabric as a recoiling SOMEONE watches with wide eyes.
SOMEONE turns his gaze out over the slate-grey water surrounding them.
He walks along the benches lining the boat's perimeter, pausing to paw at the zebra carcass.
With the animal distracted, SOMEONE starts to climb from the prow.
SOMEONE charges forward, his head jetting up from the canvas' open flap at the bow.
His enormous mass knocks SOMEONE onto his back on the canvas and the rat scurries along the cover.
SOMEONE emerges from the opening at the boat's center and climbs partway up on the canvas. The rat climbs up SOMEONE's arm and over his head.
The teen grabs the rodent.
SOMEONE pauses, staring hungrily.
SOMEONE throws the rat at the tiger who catches it in his mouth.
As SOMEONE slurps it down, SOMEONE jumps off the boat, he tries to push away on the raft but finds a line tethering him closely to the boat's prow.
As he tries to release the line, SOMEONE lunges over the prow swiping his massive claws at his head.
SOMEONE ducks and the tiger nearly falls off the boat. Scraping his rear claws against the painted metal hull, the tiger climbs back aboard.
SOMEONE pushes off from the boat on his raft.
SOMEONE returns to the center of the boat as the frightened teen paddles away. Still securely connected by the tether.
Stopping a few yards from the boat, SOMEONE vomits into the water.
At night, a full moon shines through a gap in the clouds. On the boat,
SOMEONE drags the zebra carcass out of view.
From his raft, SOMEONE watches tearfully.
His sits cross-legged, his shoulders hunched.
SOMEONE peers out at him from the edge of the boat, his parted lips showing his long, sharp fangs.
The tiger calmly flops his tail as he observes the boy.
His lips quivering.
SOMEONE regards the tiger woefully.
Thick clouds drift before the enormous full moon.
As the boat and raft float of gently rolling waves, the clouds gradually blot out the moonlight leaving the boy and tiger in darkness.
Now a rising golden sun cuts through the dark.
As it illuminates the sky, we find the boat and raft adrift on perfectly still, glassy waters that reflect the cloudy sky.
As we peer down on them from above,
we find a perfect mirror-like image of the sun-lit clouds, undisturbed on the water's surface.
SOMEONE maintains his cross-legged pose as he watches the boat.
Later he writes.
He uses blank pages in the survival book.
He write with a pencil.
He presses the tip to the paper making a period.
Later, he puts the folded torn out in an empty water can and caps it.
As we watch from a distance.
SOMEONE stands from the center of his raft and throws the can with all his might.
It lands close to us and bobs peacefully in the water.
A birds-eye view shows the can about ten yards from SOMEONE's raft sending out gentle ripples over the current-less sea.
The boy turns, looking over his shoulder.
Tethered a few yards off, the lifeboat appears empty and peaceful.
SOMEONE emerges from the canvas shelter at the center of the boat, steps up on a seat below its rim,
He gazes out over the vast expanse of motion-less sunlit sea.
Watching him calmly, SOMEONE crouches down and takes up the rope tether.
Tugging hand over hand, he reels the boat closer.
At the prow, SOMEONE lifts the end of the canvas cover and peers beneath.
Nestled inside, SOMEONE snarls up at him but makes no move to rise.
The carcasses of the zebra and the hyena flank the predator.
SOMEONE gives a small nod and gazes into the animal's fierce amber eyes.
The teen lowers the flap, then pushes the boat off.
Standing along in the vast, isolated expanse, he turns his gaze toward the sunlit clouds above.
Now a map from the survival book illustrates the world's ocean currents with inter-swirling circles.
Reading it on his bobbing raft, SOMEONE looks over his shoulder.
Now SOMEONE reads through the book and follows its advice.
SOMEONE notices a rash along his side.
Later, he lies back, his hands over his face.
He catches rain in the bucket, his open mouth, and cans in each hand.
SOMEONE collects water puddled on the canvas cover.
Now ten hash marks mar the hull off the prow. SOMEONE carves an eleventh with his knife.
Juxtaposed with the scenes, SOMEONE reads the book.
On an overcast day, he studies the book on his raft.
Pausing, he faces the boat.
SOMEONE uses the canvas cone.
He drags the boat sideways over the waves.
He pulls the boat close.
SOMEONE emerges from his shelter, his ears back and his eyes wide.
Standing on the raft, SOMEONE rocks the boat by its prow.
Blinking his amber eyes, the tiger hangs his head and convulses nauseously.
Gritting his teeth. SOMEONE pushes himself up on the boat's canvas cover.
He plants his feet wide apart and crouches over, getting his balance as he faces the tiger.
He lunges forward, his arms raised and spread. SOMEONE retreats to the boat's stern, sits on the rear seat and leans his face over the water.
SOMEONE watches him with wide eyes then reaches for his pants.
In front of his feet, urine hits the canvas.
Finishing, SOMEONE fiercely points downward.
SOMEONE opens his mouth wide in what appears to be a lazy yawn.
He turns, putting his tail to SOMEONE.
He sprays the teen in the face.
Sputtering, SOMEONE rolls off the canvas and the tiger reclaims it.
Now wearing the sea anchor as a hat that shades his face, neck and shoulders,
SOMEONE reels in a floating beach ball-sized device shaped like a chocolate kiss.
It collects dew.
Harvesting a plastic sack of fresh water, SOMEONE drinks through a straw.
He pours the rest into the bucket.
Later, he hefts the bucket into the lifeboat, setting it on the seat at the stern.
He raises the whistle to his lips.
The tiger emerges from his shelter.
SOMEONE pushes off as SOMEONE approaches the bucket.
The tiger bats it gently, sniffs it, and sticks his face in.
He writes in the survival book.
He baits a fishing hook with chewed biscuit then lowers it into the water.
From the lifeboat, SOMEONE licks his chops as he looks on.
SOMEONE faces him.
The boy tries casting the line again.
Later, the low sun casts a shimmering beam across the sapphire blue ocean.
SOMEONE paces along the seats, peering into the water.
We glimpse a few green-tinted shapes swimming just below the surface.
Prepping his fishing line, SOMEONE glances up at the tiger.
A few fish splash the water surface.
SOMEONE jumps in.
SOMEONE looks up, his eyes wide.
From underwater, we watch SOMEONE paddling expertly among the darting fish.
His head held high, he snaps his jaws at one and misses.
Looking on, SOMEONE allows an amused smile.
Shaking water out of his pressed back ears, SOMEONE turns toward him.
SOMEONE's smile fades.
Grabbing the tether, he tugs hand over fist to reel himself toward the boat.
SOMEONE, paddles steadily, his gaze calm.
As SOMEONE nears the boat, the tiger draws close to him,
the teen climbs aboard just as the predator reaches his rafts outer spokes.
The tiger tries to climb the raft, then the ship's hull.
His claws find no hold in its painted metal.
SOMEONE tries climbing aboard the raft from another spoke.
From the boat, SOMEONE struggles to heft up the raft.
Lying back, he uses one leg as extra leverage. The tiger hangs off the far spokes, adding to its weight then drops into the water.
With the raft resting on the canvas cover,
SOMEONE circles the boat, pawing at its hull.
SOMEONE takes a hatchet from the supply hatch.
He glances around, then beats SOMEONE at the side of the boat and raises the hatchet.
The tiger hangs on by ropes draped around the hull. Staring him down, SOMEONE's gaze softens.
The mostly submerged tiger stares up at him helplessly.
Clinging to the ropes with his front claws.
Lowering the axe, SOMEONE gets down and kicks a seat.
As he looks around, SOMEONE paddles along the hull and tries again without success.
SOMEONE taps the boat's inner wall with his hatchet, the ducks into the canvas shelter.
He emerges, the stands and peers over the side of the boat.
Standing between the two broken stumps of a broken off bench that once stretched across the boat,
SOMEONE looks around again.
He crouches and lifts up a hatch in front of his feet.
He sets the sizable pallet of wooden slats on the seat then reaches for his raft.
At dusk, our gaze drifts over the water, back to the boat.
A beam of light dances up through the canvas.
SOMEONE emerges from the shelter with a flashlight in hand.
Shining it over the side, he finds SOMEONE clinging to the whole rope.
He lowers his raft, now larger, sturdier, and stocked with supplies, over the other side of the boat.
He keeps hold of it with a rope as he crosses back to SOMEONE's side and puts the whistle to his lips.
He drops the slatted pallet overboard.
Attached to the boat with ropes, it forms a crude ladder.
As SOMEONE uses it to climb on board,
SOMEONE jumps off the other side and lands on his raft.
Standing on his hand-crafted flotation vessel,
the teen slowly lets out the tether connecting him to the boat.
SOMEONE arrives back on board.
His soaked fur revealing his lean frame.
As he shakes himself off,
SOMEONE watches him carefully.
The tiger faces him, then steps down out of view.
Now, under sun-lit water, we watch fish swim beneath the improved raft.
Our view surfaces to find SOMEONE seated at one end making notes as he overlooks his stock of supplies.
He marks off an illustrated list.
Later, as he makes modifications to the raft,
an enormous green fish with a blue crest swims toward a net dangling from the humble craft.
Re-attaching a life jacket to an oar beam, SOMEONE pauses and stares down at it.
The colorful fish swims right into the net.
Reaching down, SOMEONE gingerly scoops up the other sides, closing it off, then yanks the fish out of the water.
Straddling the new criss-crossing grid of oar beams, SOMEONE struggles to wrestle the fish into submission.
Roughly 2/3 his size, the fish thrashes wildly in his grasp.
SOMEONE pins it down on an oar beam, stretches one arm out and grabs the hatchet from the edge of the supply pallet. He sits up, holds the fish down with one hand and uses the other to club the fish with the blunt end of the hatchet.
He pauses, his features set in a savage glare.
The stunned fish feebly works its sharp-toothed jaws, blood seeps out beneath its gill.

His lips curl into a delighted child-like smile as he sets off the bright glow with strokes of his hand.
As his movements gain intensity, the resulting glow gathers mass and brightness.
It illuminates SOMEONE's grinning face as he plays.
The boy slows to a halt, his smile fading.
From the depths, a slowly glowing shape rapidly ascends between the raft and lifeboat.
It's a humpback whale.
The creature leaps from the water as big as a small ship.
SOMEONE stares as the gigantic whale corkscrews through the air, glowing water streaming from its fins.
Descending, it lands on the tether and overturns the raft.

Now a long row of hash marks wraps around the prow.
Wearing his shirt as a turban,
SOMEONE scratches yet another SOMEONE with his knife, then sheathes the blade.
He pushes himself along the hull, standing on a new triangular version of the raft.

The SOMEONE retreats under SOMEONE's skirt as the

taps the letters. The bird lights on her shoulder.
The bird moves to the floor in front of her.
Hanging his head, the bird trudges away. SOMEONE SOMEONE squints and
taps her stick. Sparks spray from it and the kids unfreeze. They stare at SOMEONE.
As she eyes them firmly, the parlor door opens behind her.
She steps aside. As SOMEONE and his sister rise from the floor, SOMEONE straightens his tie. The kids file out of the parlor past SOMEONE.
SOMEONE blinks disbelievingly at the well-behaved group.
She watches as they head upstairs.
In the parlor.
She hands him the letters. Glancing at her, he smiles faintly, then turns back to face the room. He finds the elegant dishware unbroken on the table.
The candy dish sits by, perfectly intact. The unharmed tractor drawing rests on a shelf.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze to a bench seat against a wall. Toting the cricket bat, he heads over and places the letters on the sill above the seat back. His eyes take in SOMEONE as he walks back to her. He hands her the bat.
As SOMEONE leaves the parlor, the mole above SOMEONE's upper lip disappears.
She eyes Mr. Edelweiss.
She looks at a window which opened.
As she strides out of the room, Mr. Edelweiss obeys. Now, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE in the kitchen.
SOMEONE tilts her head.
She leans the bat on the stair rail.
In a disheveled attic bedroom, a miniature carousel spins.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE cower as SOMEONE enters. SOMEONE and his sister scoot back on their beds.
SOMEONE stares stoically, her snaggletooth pressing into her lower lip. She produces her walking stick from inside her frock and raises it. In the kitchen, SOMEONE sets a teakettle on the stove.
SOMEONE rubs her eyes.
At a second look, she finds the staircase as plain as ever. She collects a teapot from the kitchen table and turns her attention to the sink. The front door behind her opens and a goat steps inside. With her back to the animal, SOMEONE washes dishes. As the goat creeps to the stairs, SOMEONE sniffs the air. So does the goat.
SOMEONE resumes her work. The goat hurries upstairs. It disappears around the corner just as SOMEONE turns. She sets the now clean teapot on the table, then turns her back to the door again and smooths a clock at a sideboard. As she arranges a setting on a tray, a cow enters the house. Geraldine glances at the oblivious woman, then hooves her way upstairs.
to the sink, a baby elephant enters the house.
She shields the elephant from SOMEONE.
SOMEONE turns.
The elephant nudges SOMEONE with its trunk.
As SOMEONE turns away, SOMEONE directs the elephant up the stairs with a friendly pat on its rear.
SOMEONE starts for the door. SOMEONE emerges from the pantry.
SOMEONE beams. SOMEONE produces a lantern.
The door shuts.
The SOMEONE gazes at the children's window.
The dark hairy mole on SOMEONE's chin vanishes.
SOMEONE skulks past a gatepost and nearly bumps into her.
She brushes past him and strolls off with her lantern.
SOMEONE's gaze darts. He hunches low and sneaks onto the farm proper toting a shovel. The saboteur freezes warily then trots on. Now curtains drawn over the children's bedroom window flutter. We glide through them and inside. At the foot of the nearest bed, a carousel night light glows softly. A lamp at the head of the bed illuminates the girls sleeping toe-to-toe under the covers next to Geraldine who snores.
In the next bed over, the goat sleeps with his head on a pillow next to
SOMEONE's slumbering face and SOMEONE sleeps with his head at the foot of the bed. Like the girls and cow, all three share a single blanket. Across the room, SOMEONE sleeps by the baby elephant.
SOMEONE's trunk steals SOMEONE's half of the covers. The chilly boy curls up. Now framed photos show SOMEONE and Rory on their wedding day and Rory playing cricket. In bed, SOMEONE reads a worn letter, then sniffs a dried flower folded inside. She presses the letter to her lips.
Outside, by the side of the barn he digs a hole.

and sticks his head into the hole. He braces himself with both arms as he walks his legs up the side of the barn and eases deeper inside.
Outside, SOMEONE gets stuck up to his chest.
His feet flail in the air, they flop over and he pulls himself out.
As he stands to walk away, one of his feet slips into the hole and he falls flat.
He scrambles up.
He glances at the house as another pig follows.
Another piglet trots off. Daytime. A rooster perches on the hood of the tractor. Now in the children's room, SOMEONE's shadow passes over their sleeping forms. The animals are gone.
As she leaves, SOMEONE peeks under his covers.
The children join them. SOMEONE marches downstairs in purple pajamas and a full-face gas mask with a single snout-like filter. He eyes SOMEONE suspiciously as she cooks, then strides to a seat at the head of the table. SOMEONE stares at his headgear and cocks her head.
SOMEONE serves breakfast.
SOMEONE hurries into SOMEONE's room and opens the wardrobe. She rifles through floral sundresses hanging inside.
Back in the kitchen.
SOMEONE rushes out.
The pane falls inward and shatters.
Later, he flies to a fence and burps.
He soars into the barn. SOMEONE knits her brow and follows him inside.
She peeks into the hole.
Now inside, SOMEONE repairs the window.
She smooths putty at the seam.
SOMEONE mouths Ew, affecting a mock fearful expression.
SOMEONE descends the stairs in a flowing white gown of layered tulle. She wears a silky veil.
She studies the dress. Outside, SOMEONE carries a bucket into the barn.
He finds the pigpen empty. In the kitchen.
She lifts her brow and raises her stick, then leans it gently against the table.
SOMEONE blinks thoughtfully, then doffs his mask.
He storms out after his cousins. SOMEONE lingers on the staircase landing. SOMEONE summons a breath, picks up her gnarled walking stick, and faces the girl. The SOMEONE looks from the open door to SOMEONE.
SOMEONE steps closer.

Back at the farm.
She bangs her walking stick on the ground, creating sparks. At the tree, the piglet runs up the trunk.
Boys gape. It bounced to a branch high over their heads.
The piglet performs a flip, somersaults through midair, then lands easily back on the branch.
It smiles at them. The boys swap looks. One hoof slips off, bouncing the branch.

The six pig hold it in his hooves. The five others fling the flower, the pig into the air.
Splashing the water,
by the children, the pigs swims in circle,
then glide away in a queue.
The first pig does a backstroke.
Now on a road, SOMEONE haps upon a man driving a horse drawn cart.
He hustles along as the farmer halts.
The saboteur thoughtfully slows to a stop.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze and hustles off down the road.
hops to the cart. Now all five children meet on a hilltop. The pigs race away through a meadow.
SOMEONE draws in the dirt. Later, apples lie on a wooded road. SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit astride a branch above, holding SOMEONE's veil.
The girls perch high on the road shoulder. SOMEONE cups his hands.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold the veil between them. Under the branch, the piglets barrel down the road toward them. SOMEONE runs after them, driving them along, holding his safari hat in place with one hand.
The steep embankments on either side of the road help
the animals gallop by.
Together Mouth three, two, one and drop the veil like a net. Now, in the barn.
SOMEONE gives a smarmy wave good-bye. SOMEONE sinks down.
Outside, the five children return with the piglets. SOMEONE dashes through the barn, SOMEONE trailing closely behind.
He stares wide-eyed. SOMEONE and SOMEONE carry a few

Noticing SOMEONE, she straightens and frowns.
SOMEONE stares at the girl with a furrowed brow.
SOMEONE returns the torn filthy veil wadded up in a ball.
As SOMEONE stares at it, SOMEONE remorsefully hangs her head.
SOMEONE observes.
Her unibrow vanishes. She catches a piglet watching her. SOMEONE winks and the animal winks back. She puts a shushing finger to her lips and the piglet joins its siblings. Farmer SOMEONE watches with a puzzled frown.
As the cart leaves, two piglets peer over the back gate.
SOMEONE tilts her head.
SOMEONE turns. The limousine approaches.
Running to the car, she opens the passenger door and finds the backseat empty. SOMEONE shuts the door with a wounded gaze. SOMEONE looks on sympathetically as his sister faces SOMEONE.
Her brother glances toward their cousins.
The chauffeur meets her gaze.
SOMEONE holds out a shoebox of SOMEONE's egg blue marked with a scallop-shell logo. SOMEONE slowly takes it from him.
Under SOMEONE's compassionate gaze, SOMEONE hangs her head then steps away.
The chauffeur sadly faces forward.
The city girl marches out through the farm gate, biting her rosy lips in a suppressed sob.
SOMEONE follows his sister. Heading into a lush green field, SOMEONE chucks the shoebox to the ground. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare after their unhappy cousins, then turn away and head toward the barn. SOMEONE observes the children, then shifts her thoughtful gaze.
Above, clouds drift across a violet sky. Later, SOMEONE sits dejectedly on the edge of SOMEONE's bed. The farm girl enters with the shoebox and sets it down beside her cousin.
SOMEONE shrugs. Sitting by her, SOMEONE puts the box on her own lap. She admiringly sets the lid aside, reaches into the rosy tissue paper, and pulls out a graceful pale pink slipper. It bears an ankle strap at the back and a pale pink bow and rhinestone buckle on the closed toe.
The farm girl faces her cousin and finds her expression sincere. She puts the shoe back in the box, sets it aside, and goes to a trunk at the foot of her bed. SOMEONE cranes her neck to watch. SOMEONE pulls out some brown velveteen pants and a crisp white blouse, both neatly folded.
She lays them beside SOMEONE, then sits and returns the shoebox to her lap. With a faint smile, the city girl picks up the dainty blouse which bears small blue toned polka dots. She holds it to her chest and smiles. SOMEONE lays it aside and regards the velveteen. Our view dips to a pair of hands scrubbing filthy fabric. At a bathtub, SOMEONE massages lather into her wedding veil, bites her lips, then checks the rinsed cloth. It bears a one-inch hole. In a gold-tinged flashback, a modest carriage stands adorned with sunflowers, roses, and a Just Married sign. In the driver's seat, a handsome man in a black jacket and a boutonniere made of barley sprigs beams at his bride, SOMEONE. A wreath of flowers holds her snowy veil upon her head. As we glimpse SOMEONE eyeing the ruined veil, she remembers laughing merrily with her groom. They stand in the mud. He in his boots and she, luxuriantly, dipping in her bare foot. Rory scoops SOMEONE into his arms. They share a loving kiss and he carries her toward the house. She clings to him, holding her shoes and wedding bouquet. Back in the present, SOMEONE hangs the tattered veil on a clothesline. As it flutters in a breeze, our view of its SOMEONE trim blurs.
She eyes the large manure patty
SOMEONE wears seven colorful medals.
He perches on her shoulder.
The bird covers his beak with his wing.

Mrs. SOMEONE gazes sadly as SOMEONE hikes toward them.
SOMEONE glances at the old woman, who swallows hard.
SOMEONE's joyful smile fades slightly. Standing apart, SOMEONE steps forward. SOMEONE faces SOMEONE and the children.
He holds the envelope out to his sister-in-law. She accepts it bravely, turns it over in her graceful hands, and musters a smile.
SOMEONE looks away. SOMEONE faces Mrs. SOMEONE.
The old woman nods. As SOMEONE turns away, Mrs. SOMEONE's brow furrows compassionately. Her lips pressed into a brisk smile, SOMEONE opens the envelope. SOMEONE's chest heaves. As his mother reads the telegram, her smile vanishes.
She sinks to the ground. SOMEONE takes the message.
SOMEONE sits close to SOMEONE as his older siblings read.
SOMEONE drops his full glass of ginger beer and SOMEONE collapses behind their mother. SOMEONE bows her head. As SOMEONE listlessly steps away, SOMEONE crouches before SOMEONE and the Docherty's draw near.
The husband reaches for SOMEONE, but his wife tactfully restrains him. SOMEONE continues through the field, leaving the others behind. As SOMEONE stares off with heartbroken gaze, SOMEONE clutches her hand in both of his.
Now the sun shines cheerily on the barn. Inside, SOMEONE sits slumped on the Scratch-o-matic seat. He takes a ragged breath. Watching him from the doorway, SOMEONE meekly shifts on his feet.
SOMEONE turns to face him. His gaze solemn, SOMEONE steps up alongside him.
He looks up, admiring the Scratch-o-matic.

Now, Topsey and Turvey join SOMEONE on the country road.
They each grab a shoulder.
SOMEONE dismounts and waits as SOMEONE and SOMEONE climb out of the sidecar.
Both boys wear suits. SOMEONE's is blue gray and SOMEONE's is checked with a purple necktie. They eye the towering building, then stride toward it.
Black boots block their way. The boys sweep their eyes up the red coat of a barrel chested guard in a tall bearskin hat.
SOMEONE mouths, Tell him, to SOMEONE.
SOMEONE's lips stutter.
SOMEONE wears a military uniform and
Jeffreys spins his rifle, then shoulders it and stands at attention.
The boys exchange a look.
She salutes, then heads over.
Sergeant Jeffreys uneasily shifts his gaze.
She gives a nod. Sergeant Jeffreys smiles.
Grinning, the boys follow the sergeant as he marches past sand bag barricades through a doorway. The boys glance back at SOMEONE, garbed once again in her black dress. She knowingly touches the side of her nose. Sergeant Jeffreys leads SOMEONE and SOMEONE down a corridor to an elevator where they ride to the 100th floor. On the top floor, they pass military strategists who position model planes, ships, and tanks on a table map as big as eight king size beds.
Back on the farm. The girls find SOMEONE and SOMEONE in the kitchen.
Leafs through the contract.
Back at the War Office, SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk side by side down a narrow red carpet.
At the end of a long room, the carpet spreads into a square underneath a wide desk. A mustached man in a military uniform stands behind it. As the boys stop in front of his desk, he stares down at them with stern eyes.
Lord SOMEONE's eyes widen at SOMEONE. He sets his glasses down on his desk, then steps out from behind it. With his arms crossed at his back, he regards the boys frankly.
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a nod.
Lord SOMEONE listens.
SOMEONE presses his lips tightly.
Licking his lips, SOMEONE lowers his gaze.
Lord SOMEONE closes the distance between them and glares at SOMEONE.
SOMEONE glances at his cousin's anguished face.
Lord SOMEONE stares, his reddened face almost queasy.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze from SOMEONE to Lord SOMEONE. The man looks into his nephew's unwavering eyes, then opens his mouth to speak. His lips stutter.
With an embarrassed look, he turns away.
The boys watch as he walks back behind his desk and straightens his tie. Lord SOMEONE stares downward, picks up his glasses, then lifts his gaze thoughtfully to the boys before him.
As he trudges out of the room, SOMEONE rests a hand on SOMEONE's shoulder. At the farmhouse, SOMEONE clutches a pen in his hands as he hovers over SOMEONE, watching her review the contract.
As he leans over her shoulder, the fountain pen poised, SOMEONE gives him a look.
SOMEONE yanks the pen from SOMEONE, then continues reading. SOMEONE steps up onto a chair.
Glancing at him, SOMEONE stomps to the chair. She kneels and peeks underneath.
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a puzzled look, but
SOMEONE grabs it and stows it in her tool belt.
SOMEONE leans against a wall.
SOMEONE nods sadly. He swallows hard.
SOMEONE hangs his head.
The boys look to the door where an officer enters with Lord SOMEONE. The officer gathers a long strip of ticker tape as it trails behind him. Lord SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE averts his heartbroken gaze, then furrows his brow.
It's Lord SOMEONE.
SOMEONE releases him, then turns to SOMEONE.
They start to run.
The boys stop by the door. With a tender look, Lord SOMEONE strides down the narrow red carpet, his eyes on his son. He faces SOMEONE and takes a breath. The boy holds his father's gaze.
Cyril's lips purse into an uncertain smirk. His father flashes a hint of a smile, then nods.
Lord SOMEONE allows his smile through.
He shakes SOMEONE's hand.
With a nod, SOMEONE releases his father's hand and turns away. Lord SOMEONE watches the boy shoot him a final glance, then exit the room.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE hurry through the War Office building.

He knocks a piece to the floor. The girls share a glance as SOMEONE tears apart

SOMEONE rolls her eyes. Back at the farm, SOMEONE sits alone in the barn and watches some chickens. The baby elephant appears behind him and taps him with its trunk.
The elephant curls its trunk, then extends it.
SOMEONE sets two pens beside SOMEONE who holds her head as she reads the papers.
There's a third pen on the contract for SOMEONE. The elephant's trunk sneaks up from under the table and steals it.
SOMEONE reaches for his pen, but it's gone. He pats the table.

SOMEONE and SOMEONE stifle their grins as SOMEONE searches under the table. They see the elephant leaving.
SOMEONE sees him off.
SOMEONE's head rises from behind the tabletop as he straightens and eyes SOMEONE. With a dry look, he brushes his bangs out of his face. Now SOMEONE's motorcycle speeds down the road.
In the sidecar, SOMEONE glances at his wristwatch.

SOMEONE sadly eyes her daughter as SOMEONE stands and uncaps the pen.
SOMEONE holds her gaze.
He puts the pen in her hand and she pushes him away.
SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE aside.
They watch with terrified looks.
Outside, an enemy plane soars in the sky.
Below, in the house, SOMEONE starts to sign the deed.
As he sneezes, the pilot's head bobs, dropping dangerously close to a red control button. SOMEONE finishes writing her first name.
The nose hits the button and it lights up.
SOMEONE's pen bumps the paper too hard and spills ink on the deed. She and the kids rush to the window.

She leaves him.
Now in the barley field, the bomb stands lodged, nose first in the ground. Mr. SOMEONE stands on a ladder over its steaming tail vent. As he refers to his manual, he spots the others on the field's edge.
Mr. Edelweiss lands atop a quaint Vardo styled wagon. As Mr. SOMEONE peers into the bomb's tail, his eyes widen. He swings backward and the ladder tips.
SOMEONE races towards the bomb.
SOMEONE chases the kids.
In the house without a chair, SOMEONE balances on one foot, crosses the other over as if sitting, and props an elbow on his crooked knee.
He releases the pose.
He grimaces.
Outside, SOMEONE stands on the ladder and peers through a circular opening in the bomb that has louvers like a window shutter.
SOMEONE removes the circular vent. She tosses it.
SOMEONE removes a pair of scissors from her tool belt. Peering into the vent, she tries to work the scissor blades past the protective metal spiral coiled around the wire. They won't fit. The others watch nervously.
As everyone searches their pockets, SOMEONE's face lights up.
She takes out a manicure case and removes a pair of nail scissors.
She hands them to SOMEONE, who grins, then passes them up the ladder to SOMEONE. SOMEONE receives the scissors and inspects them.
SOMEONE gives a relieved nod. SOMEONE reaches through the bomb's vent and works the scissors between two of the coils. She snips the wire.
He frees up a hand and grabs a shaker off the table to season his eggs. He dips a finger in for a taste, then moves a pan onto a burner and pours the eggs in.
Miss SOMEONE and Miss SOMEONE stand behind him.
They wear candy striper uniforms. Outside by the bomb.
SOMEONE leans into the bomb, her arms stretching toward the wire. The tip of her scissors stop a few inches away.
She keeps trying. As SOMEONE bites a knuckle, SOMEONE waits anxiously. Mrs. SOMEONE startles them.
She glances at SOMEONE. The kids return their attention to SOMEONE, who leans down into the vent and stretches her arms toward the red wire. Her scissor blades close around it and she snips through. She straightens and looks at the others.
A large blonde woman shows a stuffed and mounted owl.
She has a doll sized replica of SOMEONE.

She hits the wire. The countdown stops.
The red bulbs close up.

She smiles at the loving group. SOMEONE points to the sky

SOMEONE eyes him.
She lifts her chin.
The others flee.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE pull an IV bottle of pink fluid from their medical bag. SOMEONE jerks against his handcuffs.
Inside, the boys and SOMEONE peek out from behind the wagon, as Mr. Edelweiss, now enormously round like a balloon, descend to SOMEONE. The girls take cover behind a trough with Mr. SOMEONE. SOMEONE catches the bird, points him in a new direction, and releases him.
He floats high, flapping his wings which appear puny compared to his inflated body. SOMEONE watches with an awestruck gaze.
SOMEONE raises her walking stick.
In the kitchen. The windows burst open.
She seizes a banister.
The door swings shut.
As the wind dies down, SOMEONE descends safely to the floor.
He sits on the stove.

Snowflakes. The children hold up their hands and Mrs. SOMEONE tried
catching some in her open handbag.
Turning on the spot, SOMEONE stops, facing the field and stares.
The SOMEONE's follow his gaze. Their mouths agape.
Our view sweeps out to the field where SOMEONE stands among a vast and tidy arrangement of the baled and bundled crops.
SOMEONE returns.
The slide leans on a hay bale.
Smiling, SOMEONE follows the others out to the slide. Mrs. SOMEONE lags behind with a bittersweet gaze.
SOMEONE slides down the tin chute.
SOMEONE takes the next turn, followed by Mr. SOMEONE.
SOMEONE joins SOMEONE.
SOMEONE blinks wistfully.
She tenderly faces Mrs. SOMEONE with her snaggletooth smile.
The two share a warm smile and hug. SOMEONE peers toward the children, then steps away. Mrs. SOMEONE gazes after her tearfully, then faces the children with a sobbing breath. Now atop the hay bale, SOMEONE discovers the Medal for Resolve pinned to her overalls. SOMEONE wears the Medal for Kindness.
SOMEONE has one too. As SOMEONE cherishes the Leaps of Faith Medal, SOMEONE admires yet another.
SOMEONE points.
Shading his eyes, SOMEONE spots her halfway across the field.
Mr. Edelweiss takes flight.
SOMEONE's got a medal too.
SOMEONE and the kids run off.
Mr. SOMEONE steps up beside his wife.
up the wooded road, SOMEONE leads the chase after her.
Leaving the woods, SOMEONE rounds a turn, stops running and stares. She steps forward. Her eyes wide.
The children catch up to her.
Taking in her emotional smile, they follow her gaze. Atop a distant ridge, SOMEONE swaps cordial bows with Rory.
He drops a duffle bag. With one arm in a sling, he raises the other in a wave and runs forward.
The kids dash out to meet him.
SOMEONE beams as her husband races to their children, his face illuminated by his warm toothy grin. Leading the others, SOMEONE flings his arms around his father who scoops him up and spins him around.

He kisses the boy's neck. SOMEONE joyfully strolls up to join them. Setting SOMEONE down, Rory straightens and meets her

The two cling to each other in a fast embrace, then draw SOMEONE, SOMEONE
SOMEONE and SOMEONE
Facing them, Rory warmly extends a hand to his nephew.
Her snaggletooth gone from her lovely face,
a warm smile brightens her pleasing features.
As the reunited family heads down hill, SOMEONE finds Mr. Edelweiss perched by her side.
She pets her shoulder.
He jumps up and down happily, then alights upon her shoulder. SOMEONE beams at the bird, then turns her back to us and strolls toward a gentle valley.
Back on the other side of the grassy ridge, wild flowers blanket the field between us and the distant SOMEONE. Silhouetted against the sunny sky, the magical woman slowly descends out of view. Cut to black. Words appear. The end. SOMEONE's silhouette appears in profile above them.
The figure taps her walking stick. We drift into the silhouette and find a cartoon where SOMEONE pedals the Scratch-o- matic
The meters needle jumps to
Our gaze flies along the contraption to three brushes, each scratching a piglet.
Five children peek out from her skirt, then tumble out and frolic away.

An enormous saucer shaped craft hovers just above the rim of the falls.
The plunging water sends up pale mist that swirls around the ship.
From a distance we watch a cloaked, hooded figure walk over a rocky bank to the waters rim.
From within the hood, a stone-white human like face, with masculine features peers out through deep-set eyes, with enormous dark irises.
He serenely looks up at the ascending saucer-shaped craft.
The humanoid sets out a bowl with a heavily etched lid.
He doffs his cloak.
Revealing a pale hairless body of flawless muscle tone and proportion. Wearing only a primitive undergarment around his hips.
The humanoid crouches and uncaps the bowl.
A membrane covering a small cup disintegrates.
Standing, the humanoid peers into the cup and its disintegrating honeycomb-like contents. The humanoid brings the cup to his lips and drinks.
He watches the departing craft.
Still holding the cup.
He lurches over.
It drops from his grasp and plummets over the falls.
Large dark lesions break out all over his body.
One makes a seam down the side of his face and he stares at his transforming arm.

A black fluid gushes through it.
Within, a microscopic view shows golden strands of DNA blackening, then breaking apart.
On the cliff.

A woman pulls more rock away increasing its size.
As she peers in, we glimpse her brown eyes and delicate features.
Auburn bangs peak out from under her hat.
Clearing away more rubble, she peers through the hole again and smiles excitedly.
Now, a figure moves down a steep verdant slope in the mountains.
Two more figures leave a cave, high behind him, as he waves his arms.
From a campsite, another man steps closer and lowers a scarf from his face.
Holloway glances back at two colleagues, then drops a pan and dashes up the slope.
Words appear.
2089, Isle of Skye, Scotland.
Later in the cave.
Holloway pulls a plastic curtain aside and his female colleague steps through with a flashlight.
She nimbly trots along.

Holding a basketball in one hand, he strides through the ships chambers.
Lights turn on as he passes, then blink out again.
Pausing by a table, he crouches and picks something up off the spotless floor.
Moving on, he bounces the ball.
In a cockpit, he activates a computer with a three-dimensional holographic screen.
A screen at the top shows a girl playing a violin.

A little dog accompanies an old man.
A living area appears before him as he advances.
SOMEONE's smile fades.
They both comply.
SOMEONE and Holloway go to either side of the holographic speaker.
As Weyland turns and walks away, his surroundings blink out.
The holographic man vanishes, ending the playback.
He shows a silver cube.
Holloway presses a few squares that make up the cube and it projects a series of images.
He lines up the images to show overlapping patterns.
He sets the discs in a map.
He zooms the map in.

The gray sphere orbits it.
The mohawked crewman gives a nod.
SOMEONE grins.
Holloway nods to SOMEONE.
The mohawked crewman lays his face in his hands.
SOMEONE laughs then speaks up.
SOMEONE regards SOMEONE attentively, then lowers his contemplative gaze.
Now, blue flame glows within the Prometheus' jets as it nears the mysterious moon.

Another field shows swirling patterns, indicating previous lava flow.
A dome shaped formation juts from a range of hills.
We gaze down on the SOMEONE as it progresses past jagged blades of rock.
SOMEONE faces the Scottish woman.
He gives a smile.
Now, we soar through a barren, unforgiving mountain range.
The ship slows as it approaches a gap between two outcroppings.
Holloway eyes a display monitor. It shows a structure peeking out from behind a mountain.
He gets up.
He peers out a window.
Clearing the gateway, the ship turns towards a low structure built in the distant valley.
The ship's jets rotate downward.
They slow the ships descent to a controlled pace.
The jets bring up massive clouds of dust around the ship as it touches down.
Overhead, the enormous ringed planet glows softly beside the sun.
Domes resembling the tops of beehives surrounded by stone walls dot the valley in single file.
Roughly a mile apart from each other.
On board SOMEONE, Holloway rushes to the front windows, while SOMEONE follows warily.

The mohawked man moves down a few spots.
The hanger hatch lowers making an exit ramp.
The transport pulls out alongside two ATVs.
In the transport, Holloway moves close to SOMEONE.
Holloway chuckles.
He presses her helmet to his with an ardent gaze, then turns away.
SOMEONE adverts her troubled gaze.
The transport leads the two ATVs to an opening in a wall surrounding the structure.
A sharp crust tops the beehive like doom.
Holloway and SOMEONE come forward, crowding the front of the cabin with SOMEONE as they stare out the windshield.
The crust rounded front gives a hint of wind-eroded carving of a face.
The survey vehicles pull up around the dome and park.
A side hatch in the transport rises and SOMEONE leads the others out.
Her helmet's computerized view shows long, low entrances carved into the dome's base.
In the dark cockpit, SOMEONE stands behind the captain's chair.
The other survey team members leave the ATVs staring up.
Holloway ventures forward and SOMEONE follows.
The team members approach one of the entry ways, each carrying a kit or bag of varying size.
We peer up at the approaching humans from a sandy slope dotted with sharp rocks.
Crossing the threshold, they head down the slope.
SOMEONE regards the space with a calm expression.
A view through a helmet camera shows a few of the team exploring the cavernous space.
Various readings border the image along with the user's name, SOMEONE.
Now, Holloway's view closes in on a cave opening.
As the team ventures in, holographic monitors each show the captain a crew member's computerized helmet view.
Venturing through the opening.
SOMEONE draws himself up with an alert stare.
SOMEONE follows.
On the other side, SOMEONE and the mohawked man linger, sharing an uneasy gaze.
SOMEONE ducks through first.
The other man glances fearfully over his shoulder.
Further in, the team passes through a circular archway
and enters a tunnel perpendicular to their path.
They pause, shining their lights in either direction.
The mohawked man readies orbs.
SOMEONE releases two into the air. Spinning, they shine red scanner beams in all directions as they fly down the corridor.
He sends two more off the other way.
The last scanning pup vanishes around a turn.
Leaving his chair the captain goes to a layout table.
As he activates its computerized system, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE join him.
In the 3-D holograph flying red beacons map out a tunnel system.
Yellow beacons marked with surname initials SOMEONE the team member's locations. The pups split off again as the extending network of tunnels grows more complex.
The survey team reaches a rounded tunnel of dark gleaming stone.
As he leads them on, SOMEONE curiously shines her flashlight at the etched stone walls.
SOMEONE takes up the rear, closely observing his surroundings.
They venture towards a faint light in the distance.
Now, beams of light sweep erratically over rock.
Rounding a turn, the survey team steps into view and slows.
The stand in a chamber where water streams to around pit at its center.
A pup doubles back from the far wall and drops down the pit.
Water rains around the probe as it plunges several stories.
Holloway taps keys on his sleeve.
Holloway unlatches his helmet then bends over and pulls it off. Straightening he inhales deeply and pulls off his skullcap.
His breath clouds the air.
SOMEONE smiles.
Glaring scoldingly at Holloway, SOMEONE removes her helmet.
In the cockpit.
The away team moves through a dark space.
Hiking a tunnel, they sweep flashlights over their surroundings.
Trailing behind, SOMEONE spots a panel with carved dots and lines high up on the wall.
Climbing up, he notices greenish slime dripping from a few of the engraved points.
SOMEONE collects some on his gloved fingertip,
then presses it to his thumb.
As they part, the slime stretches between his fingertips.
Glowing blue particles swarm within.
SOMEONE sniffs it.
Unnoticing the others venture ahead without him.
SOMEONE runs his finger along a few of the lines and presses the engraved dots.
They light up beneath his touch.
A screen of glowing blue particles forms and races down the tunnel.
Pausing, the human team members turn.
He stares at an approaching light.
Glowing blue particles form several giant humanoids racing down the tunnel.
As SOMEONE remains in their path, they wash over him like wind.
Holloway sweeps SOMEONE out of their way. The incorporeal figures continue down the tunnel.
The team runs after the giant ghostly figures.
Lagging behind the others, a lone apparition stumbles and falls. It gets up and runs on as those ahead dart out of view.
Holloway and SOMEONE arrive in time to watch it collapse at a doorway. It's ghostly hatch lowers on top of him and he vanishes.
Staying SOMEONE with a hand, Holloway ventures forward. The others arrive behind him.
A body lies at the door.
The team approaches it.
At the door, Holloway and SOMEONE spy ancient text carved into the stone.
The strange characters fill several rows.
SOMEONE starts to leave.
He marches back indignantly.
Leaning close to SOMEONE, SOMEONE wheels around and leaves with SOMEONE.
Now, as Holloway, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE examine the decapitated body,
SOMEONE climbs a ladder.
Holloway hands over a flashlight sized device.
As SOMEONE studies the carved symbols in the wall, SOMEONE inserts a probe from the carbon reader into the alien being.
SOMEONE taps the symbols, which light up briefly with his touch.
As a pup moves in to scan the revealed chamber, SOMEONE kneels just on the other side of the door.
Her flashlight beam reveals a head, three times the size of a human's with a short elephant like trunk.
Holloway moves further inside transfixed by an enormous humanoid bust.
SOMEONE steps further in, studying the sculpted face.
the sculpture towers over hundreds of sleek gray thigh high urns.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE follow the others into the room.
One of their boots lifts from the soft dirt revealing worms wriggling about.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE aim their flashlights at the curved ceiling.
Holloway moves deeper in through the evenly spaced urns.
SOMEONE crouches down for a better look at one and reaches out to it.
Condensation beads on its flat topped metallic surface.
As SOMEONE gazes slack-jawed at the humanoid statue.
Holloway continues on around to a recess behind it.
A relief of snake-like creatures surrounding a central humanoid figure adorns the wall.
As Holloway steps around a large pedestal,
his flashlight beam shines through a huge emerald-like stone jutting from its center.
SOMEONE kneels at another urn.
A tar-like substance oozes on top.
The android tilts his head curiously and touches some spilling down the side with a gloved finger.
SOMEONE moves her flashlight beam across the high ceiling.
The painting changes.
The woman rushed back to the severed head.
On the surface, storm clouds swirl menacingly in the sky.
On board SOMEONE, SOMEONE studies images of the storm on a monitor.
In the chamber, SOMEONE and SOMEONE lift the head into a plastic bag.
SOMEONE turns to watch SOMEONE leave the bridge.
Kneeling at a clean urn, SOMEONE sprays it with a gaseous substance from a small canister.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hoist the head up between them.
Holloway leaves the carved relief in the wall. SOMEONE surreptitiously packs the urn in a canvas bag.
As he walks away the black ooze pools around the urn.
The worms wriggle in it.
Outside the dome the four researchers find only the ATVs.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE get in one.
Holloway drives off with SOMEONE on the second ATV.
A dark shadow passes over them. Above, thick black clouds engulf the dome and the enormous carved skull on its crest.
On the road leading towards SOMEONE, the ATVs travel in the dusty wake of a transport.
As the storm engulfs us, jagged shards whip around then block out our view of the fleeing vehicles.
From a long distance, the storm appears as a swiftly moving wall of roiling dirt. On SOMEONE, SOMEONE watches the approaching vehicles and storm.
The transport makes it into the hanger. As the ATVs speed in, one hits a bump and the bagged head falls off.
SOMEONE races after it.
As SOMEONE grabs it, the silica storm knocks her 50 yards into one of the ships towering landing struts. Holloway takes an ATV.
On the screen SOMEONE watches Holloway leave the ship.
The hatch closes, Holloway reaches SOMEONE.
As Holloway climbs out of the vehicle, it blows away.
The ATV tumbles through the storm.
As they take each other's hands amid the whirling shards, an outer door opens on the ship.
SOMEONE clips himself to a cable attached to SOMEONE. Meanwhile the storm lifts SOMEONE.
Holloway struggles to keep a hold on her. As SOMEONE steps out, the storm bounces him around. He makes it over to Holloway and helps him pull SOMEONE back into a recess made by the forked landing strut.
The android calmly clips the humans to his line and gives SOMEONE the okay hand signal.
He lifts a remote control and the line pulls them back towards the open door in the ship.
The clustered trio bobs and bounces as the line carries them through the harsh wind and flying shards. A crew member helps pull them on board.
Later as they move through the hanger, a crew member blasts the floor with a flame thrower.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk through a dark tunnel.
The two trapped men move on through the dark cramped space. Meanwhile, in a lab on board SOMEONE, the head SOMEONE collected rises into a glass chamber. A white mist blasts it, filling the chamber and an image appears on a monitor.
As the head slides from the chamber, SOMEONE arrives.
SOMEONE activates an arched scanner that glides over the head.
As SOMEONE studies one monitor, SOMEONE steps over the image of the head on another.
As Holloway plops down nearby with a bottle of liquor,
SOMEONE easily releases the helmet, lifting the trunk like snout.
Carefully lifting the large helmet off completely, he reveals a human-like head.
It's eyes closed peacefully.
Scaly patches and bumps mar the gray skin on its bald head.
As the others stare, SOMEONE and SOMEONE look more closely.
SOMEONE activates a probe.
She inserts it behind the engineer's ear, taps a few commands on a tablet, and waits.
Holloway lowers his drink as the cells on the engineer's head change.
The engineer's eyes twitch and open slightly.
Dark fluid oozes from small holes on either side of his brow and he grimaces painfully.
As SOMEONE activates a conveyor belt, carrying the head back to the containment chamber,
the engineer's face grimaces and winces. The chamber door slides shut and another shot of white mist blast it.
As the mist clears, the top of the head explodes, splattering the chamber walls with a greenish slime.
SOMEONE lowers her white doctor's mask, SOMEONE stares.
Holloway takes a swig from a bottle and hops down his perch on a counter.
SOMEONE glances after him then lowers her gaze.
Later, the storm continues to pelt SOMEONE. Inside SOMEONE stands by a sleep pod.
He wears the helmet with the glowing visor.
He allows a slight smile and bows his head.
Stepping over to the head of the sleep pod,
SOMEONE touches his palm to its top and a light glowing within dims.
He removes his helmet and amber visor, revealing his stoic expression.
Now, as he strides down a corridor,
he removes gloves and tosses them into a bin.
Rounding a bend, He finds SOMEONE waiting for him.
She steps before him and he slows to a stop.
She steps closer, fixing him with a piercing stare.
As SOMEONE tries to side step around her, she blocks him.
They stare at each other only a few inches apart.
She pins him to a wall.
Tensing her jaw, SOMEONE takes a deep breath through her nose and moves her hand towards SOMEONE's mouth as if to smother him.
She storms away.
SOMEONE approaches a wall of glass-doored coolers filled with supplies. Opening one,
he removes the urn he took from the inner chamber.
In the lab, SOMEONE peers through a microscope.
In the other lab, SOMEONE gently twists the top off the urn and sets it aside.
Meanwhile, with SOMEONE, a green laser beam aims at a slide.
On screen, a map of the engineer's DNA overlaps a human sample. The scientist's jaws drop.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE lifts a rack of four large vials from the urn.
Gray ooze drips off the container as he sets it down on a work surface.
The android breaks off one of the translucent, foot long vials.
As he tips it upside down
black matter collected at the bottom drips downward.
In the lab, SOMEONE peers at the monitor.
Now SOMEONE breaks off the tip of the vial.
Putting his fingertip over the resulting hole, he tips it upside down.
A tiny drop of the black matter sits on the tip of his index finger.
He lifts it to eye level and peers closely at it.
He smiles.
Now, SOMEONE enters the mess hall with a bottle of liquor and sees Holloway drunkenly fiddling with balls on the pool table.
The android lifts a glass off a shelf with his thumb and middle finger, leaving his index finger extended.
Holloway rolls a ball toward him.
Holloway shoves back his hood.
SOMEONE stares grimly at Holloway.
Holloway smiles up at him.
Keeping his index finger extended, SOMEONE pours a glass of liquor.
As he hands it over to Holloway, he dips his index finger in it.
Holloway takes it with a grin.
He takes a sip, then knocks the whole thing back.
SOMEONE smiles.
Meanwhile, in the tunnels, SOMEONE and SOMEONE come upon a pile of corpses.
Their flashlights illuminate the mangled mass over 10 feet tall.
Meanwhile, on the bridge, the holographic map shows the pups still tracing out tunnels and chambers and SOMEONE's and SOMEONE's location within.
SOMEONE stops playing a concertina and approaches a pinging red dot on the map.
The pinging probe sits motionless at what appears to be a dead end.
In the tunnel, SOMEONE peers at the map with narrowed eyes.
Watching video of the holographs in her quarters, SOMEONE speaks into a recorder.
Holloway enters.
He sets the rose in a tumbler before here.
Sitting on his lap she kisses him.
On a small handheld computer
SOMEONE brings up brings up the matching DNA graphs then hands it over to him.
She leans over and hugs him from behind with a giddy smile.
She flops down on a bed.
SOMEONE blinks back tears and shakes her head.
SOMEONE adverts her wounded gaze.
He tackles her affectionately.
He kisses her.
Gazing into her eyes he gives her a tender kiss and rubs her chest.
SOMEONE caresses his cheek then returns the kiss.
He leans in and they embrace with mounting passion.
Reaching down, SOMEONE pulls Holloway's shirt up his torso, revealing his toned sun-kissed back.
He straightens and she yanks it off impatiently.
Holloway leans down again and kisses her hungrily.
Now in a slinky black turtleneck and low ponytail, SOMEONE meanders into the cockpit.
Above the layout table, the probe beacons add additional detail to the now enormous map of the structure.
Two yellow beacons SOMEONE and SOMEONE near ground level center.
Leaning close, she reaches toward the map.
She turns, in a corner SOMEONE sits with concertina.
SOMEONE returns her gaze to the map.
SOMEONE drums the flat ends of his concertina.
He sips a drink.
She pauses as he gets to his feet.
SOMEONE  blinks at him and cocks her head.
SOMEONE lifts his brow persistently.
SOMEONE looks away then faces him with a coy smirk.
As she marches out, SOMEONE gazes after here.
As the storm rages outside, SOMEONE's helmet view shows fluid streaming from the urns.
They wander the chamber.
SOMEONE exhales smoke in his helmet.
SOMEONE sucks through a plastic hose, then blows a puff of smoke.
SOMEONE flips the British bird.
Using a space blanket, SOMEONE flips it back.
Black fluid streams along the ground.
A snake-like creature rises from the muck.
The cockpit stands empty.
As he edges closer, it rears up.
SOMEONE falls back on his rear end.
He reaches a hand out. The creature's head fans out, takes the shape of a porpoise tail.
Grinning, SOMEONE lingers close.
He reaches out again.
The creature's hood wraps around his hand and holds on tight.
It's serpentine body lashes around his arm.
It snaps his arm like a twig.
Using a knife, SOMEONE decapitates it. It sprays green blood, which burns through his helmet acidly.
The creature's head regenerates and it burrows up SOMEONE's sleeve.
It reaches his helmet.
SOMEONE falls face first into the black fluid. As he straightens, his melting helmet collapses on his face.
The serpentine creature plunges into SOMEONE's mouth and forces its way down his throat.
Now, from the dome's crust, we view a golden sun peeking over the horizon.
Silhouetted against the windows of SOMEONE's quarters, Holloway hunches over and rubs his face.
As his partner slumbers peacefully, he shuffles to a mirror. A light switches on above him.
Facing his reflection, he blinks his bleary eyes. He takes a few deep breaths, then removes a gold ring and sets it on the sink.
Bending over, he splashes water over his face and close cropped hair.
Facing the mirror again, he peers at his beady bloodshot eyes.
Broken blood vessels redden the rims of his irises.
Holloway knits his brow and leans closer to the mirror.
He lifts a hand hesitantly, then tugs down on the skin beneath his eye.
Clear fluid streams from his iris.
She touches an intercom.
Now an away team leaves the airlock.
All but SOMEONE board a transport.
Holloway regards him suspiciously.
As the transport pulls out, SOMEONE rides beside it on an ATV.
A lone crew member sees them off, then twirls his finger in the air.
Later, the vehicles approach the structures gateway.
Riding behind the transport, SOMEONE halts and gazes after it as it passes through.
Later in the structure.
the team progresses downhill to a large open doorway shaped like an egg.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE rides the ATV through the structure's tunnels.
Sipping from a porcelain cup,
SOMEONE monitors him by way of a private station.
She keeps her back to us. Her straight blond hair flowing smoothly past her shoulders.
SOMEONE halts the ATV with a frown.
SOMEONE removes his helmet.
His suit's camera shares his view as he proceeds down a corridor marked with urn-shaped etchings.
He pauses, frowning gravely.
Several yards ahead in a rounded turn, a red probe light pulsates.
With an intense stare, he proceeds toward it.
In her lifeboat, SOMEONE watches the feed projected across her windows.
As SOMEONE progresses, we find the probe hovering before a heart shaped door of multiple oblong panels.
SOMEONE eyes the probe quizzically, then turns.
As SOMEONE looks on, he enters a code into a panel beside the door.
It rises and the probe soars through.
As SOMEONE ventures forward, the doorway shows thousands of urns stacked in giant hourglass-shaped units.
The probe casts its flickering light at the far end of the chamber as the android goes in.
He observes three hourglass formations before him.
Even more urns rest in rows several feet high in recesses cut into the surrounding walls.
SOMEONE's screen shows the countless supply.
Looking on, SOMEONE narrows her blue eyes.
Crossing the mist enshrouded floor, SOMEONE arrives at another code panel.
He operates it successfully and a door rises before him.
The probes dart past two humanoid figures standing on either side in suits and masks.
SOMEONE shines his light on the apparent corpses.
Turning ahead, he slows, his lips parting.
The probe darts out past him as he enters the chamber.
Sarcophagus-like pods lie before him.
As SOMEONE watches from her lifeboat, SOMEONE cuts off the video feed.
Within the chamber, we drift up to find two more giant pods resting opposite their counterparts atop a hundred foot disc marked with a spiderweb-like pattern.
Massive pillars stripe the surrounding concave walls.
SOMEONE ventures in, dwarfed by the massive disk.
The rest of the away team arrives at the chamber with the bust.
SOMEONE eyes the humanoid corpse.
Behind SOMEONE, Holloway stumbles.
They enter the fatal chamber.
SOMEONE leans over an urn, peering closely with his flashlight.
The team moves through the dark, treacherous space.
As SOMEONE stares, SOMEONE finds a body lying face down in his suit.
He sits on the ground.
His skin bears no color. The others find SOMEONE's face green and distorted.
The serpentine creature leaps out at them.
It slithers away.
Leading the team out, SOMEONE supports Holloway.
Ducking out, Holloway collapses.
SOMEONE passes Ravel.
As she goes, Ravel watches the monitors.
At the edge of the giant disk, SOMEONE circles around a curved, throne-like chair to a control panel with rows of buttons the size and shape of eggs.
As he presses a sequence of them
they squish beneath his touch like soft hollow rubber.
An untouched button on the end pulsates with light from within.
SOMEONE presses it.
The throne-like chair rotates in his direction.
His flashlight sweeps over a treelike design on the backrest with twin egg-like patterns at the top.
SOMEONE climbs on the seat and leans back into it.
A holographic recording plays back.
Showing a helmetless engineer stepping up on the disk.
SOMEONE grins giddily.
SOMEONE shines his flashlight at the first, who bends over at one of the sarcophagus-like pods.
He gestures to a few others, who walk in and circle the disc.
One continues toward SOMEONE.
The Android springs from the chair as the engineer takes a seat in it.
SOMEONE cocks his head.
Curiously looking on as the alien rotates the chair to face the controls.
He picks up a reed-like flute and plays.
A blue and green holographic sphere rises before the pilot.
Connected to the horse shoe shaped panel by streams of green energy.
As the pilot works the controls, more emerald hued fields of energy appear above them.
SOMEONE lowers a gloved hand,
and the energy rises up to connect with it.
The android climbs up on the disc and crouches, studying the control panel.
In the recording, the leader walks over to the pilot and crouches to face him.
SOMEONE listens to their exchange.
A tremendous, three-dimensional holographic orb appears over the center of the disc. Cerulean points of light webbed together within swirl about in steady patterns.
A star system appears in its midst, complete with a ringed planet.
Staring, SOMEONE approaches the intergalactic map.
Higher up, smaller spheres with concentric orbital rings revolve around the disk.
SOMEONE steps into the mains sphere and orbital rings appear around it.
Spreading his arms wide, the pilot leans back as if playing an organ.
The main sphere diminishes and darts aside. One of the smaller orbs takes its place and grows. Smiling wondrously in its midst,
SOMEONE looks up and finds a glowing sphere hovering directly above him.
He spreads his arms wide and turns on the spot.
The pilot presses more buttons and another orb drifts downward in a net of green energy beams.
Reaching up, SOMEONE catches it lightly in his gloved hand.
As he peers curiously at the softly glowing orb, we recognize the continent of Africa.
He releases the model of earth, letting it float back up again and gazes after it ardently.
His arms spread, SOMEONE sways on the spot.
The recording abruptly cuts out.
As SOMEONE steadies himself his bewildered gaze lands on the holographic model of earth.
Rotating inches above a translucent cone-shaped face the image fades.
SOMEONE turns.
A  soft golden glow flickering on his face.
From within one of the pods an amber light fades.
Aiming his flashlight, the android approaches it wearily.
Its ornate translucent lid ends at the head with an egg-shaped hatch equipped with a handle.
SOMEONE flashlight beam shines through the barrier, revealing an engineer lying inside.
He rests motionlessly with his eyes closed and a breathing mask covering his nose and mouth.
SOMEONE plants a gloved hand and the lid and crouches close to the pod.
Turning his head  he leans an ear close to it.
SOMEONE's lips curl into a happy smile.
Meanwhile the rest of the team boards the transport.
SOMEONE cradles Holloway as he arrives.
Discolored bumps on his skin spread and darken.
The transport doors open.
The crew climbs out.
SOMEONE strides through the hanger and grabs a flamethrower.
As the door lowers, SOMEONE stops halfway down, wielding the menacing weapon.
Holloway collapses.
As SOMEONE goes to help, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE.
Holloway steps toward SOMEONE, his arms outstretched. SOMEONE holds SOMEONE back. SOMEONE ignites the flamethrower, setting Holloway on fire.
His body completely engulfed Holloway drops to his knees. SOMEONE sobs on the ground.
As Holloway's fiery body falls face first and lies still,
SOMEONE watches with a horrified expression.
SOMEONE opens her mouth wide in a grief stricken wail.
Later, wearing a white tunic,
she sleeps on a wide lit exam table.
A pair of hands reach for her cross,
and she instinctively grabs at them.
SOMEONE nods gently, and she allows him to remove her necklace.
As he steps away, SOMEONE lets her arms relax at her sides.
He puts the cross in a jar.
He runs a scan of her abdomen.
SOMEONE sits up, her jaw slack.
She stares wide-eyed and her lips stammer.
She scoots off the table.
She taps buttons on the exam table's panel.
She grips his shoulders.
Her mouth opens wide and she doubles over.
SOMEONE injects her in the back of the shoulder.
He lifts her limp body back on to the table.
As SOMEONE shifts to lie on her back, SOMEONE gazes down at her.
A tear falls from SOMEONE's eye and she shakes her head in confusion.
SOMEONE's lips tremble.
SOMEONE snatches the jar with her necklace and strides out.
SOMEONE, lying nearly motionless, stares up at the ceiling.
Taking a few deep breaths she drifts off to sleep.
She lies asleep on her side.
A hand in an oversized yellow glove gives her cheek a few brisk taps. SOMEONE remains motionless.
As a crewman in a containment suit approaches, SOMEONE whacks him with a metal object, then heads forward.
As the crewman forces her down, SOMEONE presses up on the plastic covering his face. She kicks him off of her.
As she gets down from the table, she falls briefly, clutching her abdomen.
SOMEONE races from the room but almost immediately collapses against the wall in pain.
Gritting her teeth she hurries on.
SOMEONE arrives in the room housing Vickers' med pod. She uses its touchscreen panel.
She selects manual procedure.
As the med pod rotates and tilts into an upright position,
the clear domed lid opens in three sections.
SOMEONE quickly removes her white hospital gown, revealing her bandage-like underwear, and grabs two auto-injectors.
She holds one in her mouth as she stabs her thigh with the other.
She limps over to the med pod and positions herself on the upright table under a curved scanner.
As the two bottom sections of the lid come together like a set of doors,
the upper section lowers down over the patient.
SOMEONE's taut belly bulges.
As the med pod lowers back down, SOMEONE scoots herself into position. She makes a few selections from a touch screen, projected over her head.
The scanner glides over her body.
A band of green light scans her abdomen.
As her stomach bulges up normally an image of the alien fetus appears on the screen before her.
A robotic arm equipped for surgical tools sprays anesthetics across her stomach below her belly button.
Three more arms position themselves.
One of the arms performs a precision cut with a laser.
SOMEONE arches her head way back.
The muscles in her neck tense as she grits her teeth.
As the robotic arms on either side of her pry back her skin,
SOMEONE's mouth opens wide in a pained SOMEONE. A large pair of forceps rotates into position at the top of the arched scanner.
As they lower toward her, SOMEONE gives herself another injection.
Her head relaxes back, then tenses again as the forceps dip into her open abdomen.
The forceps slowly pull the creature out. A thick tentacle wiggles inside an egg-shaped sac the size of SOMEONE's head.
Relaxing a bit SOMEONE lifts her head of the table and stares slack-jawed.
The sac brakes open splattering her with bloody fluid and revealing the squid-like alien.
She quickly grabs the umbilical cord and yanks it out. As she makes a selection on the overhead screen, the alien's four tentacles spread open and it moves its head.
Gritting her teeth, SOMEONE watches the robotic arm staple her stomach shut.
Above her the alien baby wriggles more vigorously.
Flailing its tentacles it tries to free itself from the forceps' grip.
The med pot starts to tilt upright and SOMEONE slams a button beside her.
The lid slowly opens. SOMEONE scoots down, flattening her head to one side it passes under the flailing alien.
Reaching the end of the table she quickly rushes around to the outer control panel.
The doors close back up, trapping the baby alien inside, and a white mist fills the chamber.
SOMEONE sinks to her knees and catches her breath.
She grabs some more auto-injectors from a cart,
then watches the baby alien grow still.
She quickly opens the room's door and hurries out of Vickers' life boat.
Inside the med pod blood drips from the alien's long egg-shaped head as it hangs motionless.
Now, on the bridge.
A crewman stops halfway down the lowering ramp in a space suit and helmet.
He cocks his head, then moves closer to SOMEONE who sits crouched on the ground with his legs bent forward over his shoulders.
On the bridge, SOMEONE's eyes shift nervously.
The crewman kicks SOMEONE's foot,
then backs away a few steps. He turns to a crewmate.
SOMEONE stands upright.
His smashed open helmet reveals his grotesquely deformed features.
The mutant backhands him, breaking open his helmet.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE hurriedly limps down a corridor. In the hanger, the mutant SOMEONE flings Wallace to the ground.
The mutant leaps on Wallace's stomach and the crewman spews blood. The mutant smashes both fists through his helmet, pummeling his face.
A crewman fires at the mutant, who turns his head angrily. Meanwhile SOMEONE turns briefly as she makes her way past a hanging space suit. A door to another corridor opens for her.
Meanwhile,  crewmen fire flamethrowers and guns at the mutant.
On fire, the mutant speedily scales a smooth wall, then leaps down, tackling a crewman. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand at the air-locked door.
Two guys fire on the mutant as he flings a third against a transport's window. As the men escape into a transport, the mutant lodges a metal tool into ones back and pulls him out.
The mutant falls back and the guys run over him with the transport.
As the vehicle takes off, SOMEONE and SOMEONE arrive, dousing the mutant with fire and bullets.
SOMEONE lowers the flamethrower and watches the body burn.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE gives herself another shot, then drops the auto-injector.
Our view rises from her thigh up her blood-spattered body to her drawn face.
She peers down a corridor, then lowers her hand from a concave wall, and shuffles toward a set of rounded doors.
She presses a button and the doors part.
She staggers into a room and collapses to her knees.
A man dressed in white notices her,
then helps her to her feet along with a guard.
SOMEONE notices her as well.
He quickly takes off his white coat and wraps it around the half-naked woman.
SOMEONE stares at her, sitting in a wheelchair.
He watches as the guard helps her take a seat.
Shivering, SOMEONE notices the old man.
SOMEONE returns to SOMEONE and kneels on the floor.
He washes the old man's feet.
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a cane.
then helps him put on his slippers.
SOMEONE and the aid help the decrepit old man to his feet.
SOMEONE turns away from SOMEONE and his aide readies his wheelchair.
SOMEONE lowers her distraught gaze.
Now in her cabin, she leans over her sink.
She splashes water on her face, then looks over the counter.
She picks up Holloway's ring, studies it, then slides it the ring finger of her left hand.
Gazing thoughtfully, she covers her mouth.
As she sets her hands on the counter, we glimpse the line of staples two inches under her navel.
Nodding, she glances around, then looks over the counter.
She pops a pill in her mouth, then drinks from a glass of water.
Later, she puts on her spacesuit and zips it up.
SOMEONE enters the cabin and notices his colleague in her formfitting suit.
SOMEONE returns to the sink and pops another pill.
SOMEONE heads out.
He stops at the door, then returns to SOMEONE.
Holding her gaze SOMEONE steps back and leans against the wall.
Now in SOMEONE's bedchamber, SOMEONE stands by as SOMEONE works on the back of the old man's space suit.
Doors part for SOMEONE and she steps into the room.
Two guards stand outside.
SOMEONE and the others step out, then the door slides shut, leaving SOMEONE alone with the old man.
SOMEONE peers at her.
He sits on his bed.
She approaches him and he averts his gaze.
Kneeling, she caresses his hand.
SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE bows her head.
She rubs her nose over his knuckles and he makes a fist.
She looks up at him.
He meets her piercing gaze.
She rises to her feet, Now, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE sitting in the corner of an equipment room.
He picks up a helmet.
Meanwhile SOMEONE walks down a corridor with SOMEONE and his aide close behind.
SOMEONE stands.
She doubles over in pain.
SOMEONE crosses the room.
Now a transport vehicle sets out from the ship leaving a trail of dust in its wake.
Later, in the network of tunnels, a flashlight shines through the darkness, leading the team.
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE slack-jawed.
A door rises and SOMEONE leads the group onward.
SOMEONE lags behind. The only one still wearing her helmet. As she shines her flashlight over the urns, SOMEONE watches a video feed from the bridge.
SOMEONE looks over the urns. The captain leaves his chair.
SOMEONE sits at a work station.
SOMEONE stands at the layout table.
A hologram shows the tunnel system without the surrounding terrain.
An alarmed SOMEONE stands upright.
The hologram represents an elaborate crescent shaped vessel with blunted ends.
Now SOMEONE leads the group into the chamber housing the giant disc.
He hops down from the platform, then sits in the chair and blows into the flute, calling up a holographic orb.
crosses the disc.
He leads them to the working pod.
SOMEONE collapses to her knees in pain.
SOMEONE takes off her helmet.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from the bridge.
SOMEONE touches amber lit symbols on the pod.
It opens.
SOMEONE steps past his aide who lowers a gun.
As the engineer sits up, several tubes detach from his oxygen mask.
He takes off his headgear and hunches over.
As he rises to his feet more tubing detaches. Standing upright, the pale bald titan looks over his mesmerized visitors.
As the engineer crouches, SOMEONE stumbles but SOMEONE and his aide catch him.
The engineer looks at SOMEONE.
The aide strikes SOMEONE in the gut with his gun.
The engineer looks at SOMEONE who eagerly waits for a reply.
He gently lays his hand on the top of SOMEONE's head.
With both hands, he grabs SOMEONE by the throat, then lifts him off his feet and breaks his neck.
He rips SOMEONE's head off and strikes SOMEONE with it. The aide shoots the engineer, and he drops the head.
The engineer turns SOMEONE around and palms her chest, knocking her off the platform.
He strikes the aide, flings him into a wall across the chamber, then spots SOMEONE running away, but lets her go.
SOMEONE slows to a stop and braces herself on a wall.
Now SOMEONE lies wounded on the floor.
SOMEONE's head lies about a foot away.
Eyes open, the android twitches.
On the bridge SOMEONE watches a video feed showing her father's heart rate.
She leaves the monitor.
Ravel watches the feed.
SOMEONE looks at his rattled shipmate, then lowers his gaze. He licks his lips, then shifts in his seat.
SOMEONE rubs his mouth.
Now the engineer crouches over the holographic orb.
The center of the disc drops, then rotates counter clockwise and opens for a head and pillar to emerge.
SOMEONE tries to look in its direction.
The engineer stands upright.
The rising pillar tilts, attached to a base with a seat,
like a cannon attached to a gunner chair.
The engineer faces the imposing device. SOMEONE watches him.
The gunner chair rotates.
Running through a tunnel, SOMEONE glances back.
As the engineer climbs onto the gunner chair, we glimpse SOMEONE's motionless face in profile.
The engineer takes a seat, then activates the star map.
A holographic sphere emerges around him, and widening outer rings flip into place.
SOMEONE stops to catch her breath.
As the engineer works the controls, a brief flash illuminates his crescent shaped ship. A helmet closes over him.
The helmet shields his face, then more armor shields his body. Smoke blasts from a circle of ports, blotting out our view of the ship's underbelly.
A torrent of smoke shoots through the tunnel, knocking SOMEONE off her feet.
The exhaust hurls her through  passage leading outside.
Through a window, the crew watches thin plumes of smoke rise from the ground.
As our view retracts through the star map a holographic line sets out from the gunner chair and targets hologram of the planet earth.
Amid the flow of exhaust, SOMEONE grabs hold of a ledge, and pulls herself out of a hole in the ground.
She rises to her feet, standing beside one of the erupting plumes. She runs for SOMEONE, but the ground fissures, threatening to cut her off from the ship.
As the gap widens she jumps the fissure and runs on.
We glimpse the ceiling opening up over the crescent shaped ship.
Running for SOMEONE, SOMEONE jumps another gap, but falls short and grabs hold of the opposite ledge.
She pulls herself up, then finds her path blocked for certain.
SOMEONE glimpses the rising ship, then flees the shifting ground.
As she dashes across the rocky terrain, the massive ship ascends in the background.
SOMEONE stumbles but gets up and takes cover behind a rocky pillar.
SOMEONE gives his captain an affirming glance.
Now SOMEONE runs through a corridor, unzipping her clothes. Reaching the escape pods she opens a pod door and grabs a space suit.
Blue flames ignite from the engines. SOMEONE puts on his baseball cap as he takes the helm.
The four firing engines lift the SOMEONE off the ground.
The crescent shaped ship rotates, its blunted ends turning toward the human's vessel as it rises into the sky.
The lifeboat section ejects from the ship. SOMEONE readies her space suit.
The lifeboat lands on the barren terrains, smashing a rocky pillar before it slides to a stop.
On the bridge.
SOMEONE gets in the escape pod
The pod ejects from the ship
SOMEONE watches as it loops around and swoops past her.
Touching ground, it slides to a stop.
In the cockpit, SOMEONE stands at the helm, his shipmate seated behind him.
SOMEONE rockets towards its target.
The three shipmates raise their arms overhead.
SOMEONE's nose pierces the outer wall of the larger ship, creating a fiery explosion.
As the engineer's ship careens a brilliant burst flashes,
Followed by an outpouring of smoke and SOMEONE.
SOMEONE watches from the ground as does SOMEONE.
the crescent shaped ship turns sideways and descends to the ground.
One of its blunted ends crash lands before the two survivors.
Huge plumes of smoke and SOMEONE billow from the point of impact. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare at the towering vessel, their jaws hanging slack.
The crescent shaped ship rolls their way, tipping on to the second of its blunted ends. SOMEONE and SOMEONE break into a run.
The second massive stub crashes into the ground behind them, and the ship keeps rolling.
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE desperately try to outrun the trundling vessel, fiery chunks of SOMEONE strike the ground all around them.
The rolling ship chases them past a number of rocky pillars, dotting the harsh terrain, its shadow at their heels.
SOMEONE trips and falls face down.
As SOMEONE keeps running, SOMEONE looks up at the looming mass, then rolls out of its way.
She rises to her knees and watches SOMEONE fall to the ground up ahead.
Flailing on her back, SOMEONE watches the ship's outer wall close in.
The ship' slows to a stop.
Now on its back, its blunted ends aloft.
Gawking at the towering vessel, SOMEONE rises to her feet.
The upright ship begins to tip her way.
She falls on her rear, scurries back toward some jagged rocks, then watches one end of the ship come down with no chance of escape.
As the impact plots out our view, we glimpse a burst of sparks.
SOMEONE lies in a pocket left underneath the ship, saved by the formation of jagged rocks behind her.
She looks at her wrist then turns on her side and glances around.
She crawls out from under the ship.
She rises to her feet, staggers a few steps, then glimpses an expanse of the vessel's outer wall.
The engineer's ship forms a semi-circle around her.
Turning, SOMEONE sees the lifeboat and staggers over the SOMEONE littered ground.
Small fires dot the field.
Nearing the craft, SOMEONE pauses and doubles over.
Straightening she sways on her feet, then perseveres  to the compartment's open entryway and climbs up.
She swings her legs over, pushes herself up on all fours and gets to her feet.
SOMEONE stumbles to a touchscreen control panel and works it with shaking hands.
A pair of doors slides shut behind her, sealing her inside.
She packs supplies from nearby shelves.
SOMEONE halts and turns.
Her eyes wide, she looks over her shoulder at the doors.
Facing forward, she reaches into low tool compartment and takes out a fire ax with a curved handle.
Doors ahead open, revealing the devastated remains of SOMEONE quarters.
On the far end, the false windows show the video of the little girl playing the violin.
Broken hoses, tubes and wires dangle from the ceiling panel surrounding the chandelier.
SOMEONE shovels in, removes her helmet and sets it aside.
Sparks rain down erratically from the ceiling as she ventures past the bar, her axe ready, and approaches a doorway.
Pausing at its threshold, she raises the axe and gazes down a brief passageway ending in a sealed door with two small windows.
She precedes hesitantly.
Breathing through flared nostrils.
Wet with condensation, the doors windows show the med pod moving on its own in the flickering light.
SOMEONE leans her face close to the glass peering through.
As we watch her from the other side we find blood smearing the door.
A giant tentacle slaps against the glass. SOMEONE backs away, her mouth hanging open in a terrified stare.
The tentacle rubs persistently against the window then slides down the glass.
As SOMEONE turns, the remaining engineer forces a pair of side doors open and leans through.
Charging, he backs her against a wall.
She pounds a touchscreen, a tentacle shoots out through the med pod station doors lashes around the engineer's throat and tackles him, taking SOMEONE down with them.
As the creature wraps its tentacles around the engineer, she wriggles out from beneath them both.
A spare tentacle wraps around her ankle, but she kicks it lose and scrambles away.
The creature lifts the engineer off the floor.
Grabbing her helmet, SOMEONE rushes back to the airlock compartment.
In the lifeboat, the engineer struggles pitily against the grasp of the giant squid-like creature
Flaps on its underside blossom outward like petals, revealing egg-shaped buds surrounding a vertical mouth lined with dagger-like teeth.
The engineer braces his legs against the door frame.
SOMEONE opens the air locked doors with her back and hand, then jumps out and lands in a hard roll.
In the lifeboat, the engineer snarls at the creature pulling him ever closer.
Yet another tentacle reaches out and wraps around his head.
The buds shoot out tendrils that lash around his skull and hold him still.
The mouth launches a serpentine appendage down the engineer's throat.
It pulls him close, then lowers itself on top of him.
The giant squid-like creature wriggles around completely covering its prey.
It eventually relaxes and grows still.
Outside the sun peeks through thick rolling clouds. SOMEONE weeps on her back.
On the disc, SOMEONE's head sweats.
Outside SOMEONE lifts her head.
Grimacing painfully, SOMEONE sits up.
Her gaze darts to a wrecked ATV half-buried in a mound of dirt.
In the ship, light wavers on SOMEONE's glistening face.
He listens uncertainly.
the ATV kicks up dust as SOMEONE drives it over the uneven terrain toward the engineer's crashed ship.
she steps into its dim cockpit.
Light flashes erratically.
A few feet from his head, SOMEONE's body twitches. SOMEONE steps closer and looms over them coldly.
SOMEONE puts down her bag and removes her protective space helmet.
Crouching at the android's body she rummages around and finds her cross.
Gazing tenderly at it, SOMEONE gently straightens the chain.
She solemnly puts it on over her head
and gives a relieved sigh.
Looking on, SOMEONE smiles admiringly.
SOMEONE crouches over his head.
The android stares at her with parted lips. He clamps his mouth shut.
Now, SOMEONE uses a line and pulley to lower SOMEONE's body out of an opening in the ship's hull.
His head lies on the floor by her feet, gazing up at her placidly.
The body touches down gently.
SOMEONE picks up his head in both hands. SOMEONE gives her a childlike appreciative smile as she lowers him into her bag.
The wind musses his hairline.
SOMEONE zips the bag closed over his earnest gaze.
Wincing painfully she gets to her feet and hauls the bag up.
From the edge of the hull, she repels 20 feet to the ground.
the ATV travels away from the structure along the desert valley.
It approaches the next structure.
Now we ascend through clouds.
An engineer ship rises into view.
Flaring brilliantly it darts away.
Beyond the clouds, the ringed planet glows. Fade to black.
In the abandoned lifeboat the last engineer's body convulses on the floor, surrounded by the creature's motionless tentacles.
In the flickering pulsating light his chest bulges.
An exoskeletal point resembling a giant
claw bursts out and slices through his sternum.
A skinny body with long limbs in a gleaming dark gray exoskeleton wriggles out of the hole and onto the floor.
A yellow amniotic sac pulsates beside it,
connecting the newborn to the engineer's carcass.
The new alien specimen pushes itself up on all fours. It lifts its head which bears the oversized claw like growth as a sickle shaped head crest.
The alien straightens, sitting up on its heels and looks around.
It works its slavering jaws.
A set of inner jaws pops out from its mouth.Its pink gums dripping slime.
Sitting across from them, a younger inmate glances up. The two men dig through large spools of white thread. They each pull out a gun and using the spools to conceal them, pass them to the young inmate and man sitting next to him. They stealthily tuck the weapons in their pants. From the same box, the older inmate and the sandy-haired man retrieve guns of their own. Crossing between two rows of workbenches, the sandy-haired man drops a load of shirts.

Out of the moving vehicle. SOMEONE lands
face down in the grass. SOMEONE closes the sedan's door and sits back in his seat next to the sandy-haired SOMEONE. Gathering himself, he sniffs, flaring his nostrils. Then stares forward with a steely gaze.
SOMEONE peers out the smeared windshield with a solemn expression. Now, SOMEONE stands below an overcast sky. Strands of his greasy black hair hang over his forehead. His gaze drifts to a road which cuts through a desolate field toward the flat horizon. In a farmhouse, gang members change clothes while eating. A woman wraps food in newspapers and brings it over to their table.
SOMEONE buttons up next to another escapee.
SOMEONE puts out a cigarette.
Outside, SOMEONE walks alone. Without his overcoat, he wears a black vest and a leather gun holster. The woman stops him.

Together, they wander a few steps without taking their eyes off of him. Now in the car as SOMEONE drives, SOMEONE looks back at SOMEONE.
He faces forward and glances at SOMEONE.
Now, a man in a blue suit hurries through lush green woods with a SOMEONE gun. He trips, then climbs to his feet and runs on. A clean-cut man wearing suspenders swiftly moves after him toting a rifle. A group of armed lawmen follow behind, charging up a hill.

He crosses to a desk and halts briefly by a secretary busy typing.
A couple of yards ahead, an agent on the phone sits at his desk, unaware of SOMEONE's
presence. The gangster finds another bulletin board and scans its postings. A mugshot of Homer, photos of a robbed bank and a sprawled body, and a street map. A smile crosses SOMEONE's lips as he passes through a brilliant shot of sunlight. Further along the bulletin board, he finds black and white photos of himself - others show more buildings. SOMEONE lowers his sunglasses and views photos of the Little Bohemia Lodge, the wrecked Ford, and a pair of confiscated SOMEONE guns. Now, he crosses to a bulletin board showing mugshots of SOMEONE. One is ink-stamped with the words In Custody. SOMEONE's gaze roves down a line of mugshots showing Makley, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, Homer, SOMEONE, Gil, and Youngblood, all stamped with the word Deceased.

He stops, turns, and puts his back to the cinema. Behind him, a man arrives with two blonde women, one of them in a conspicuous orange skirt.
SOMEONE blinks, then looks over his shoulder. Spotting the trio, he looks away. Across the street, SOMEONE accompanies the two women into the cinema, passing a Manhattan Melodrama poster. Entering the packed house, the crime boss leaves SOMEONE at a seat, then proceeds down the aisle with Polly.

and careworn expression.

In his head. The gray door opens and he steps out.
Sitting across from them, a younger inmate glances up. The two men dig through large spools of white thread. They each pull out a gun and using the spools to conceal them, pass them to the young inmate and man sitting next to him. They stealthily tuck the weapons in their pants. From the same box, the older inmate and the sandy-haired man retrieve guns of their own. Crossing between two rows of workbenches, the sandy-haired man drops a load of shirts.

His grip on SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> forearm gives way and the gang leader lets him go. SOMEONE's<Walter's> body slides to a stop in the dirt as the car drives off leaving a cloud of dust behind.

SOMEONE<Red> peers out the smeared windshield with a solemn expression. Now, SOMEONE<Dillinger> stands below an overcast sky. Strands of his greasy black hair hang over his forehead.

A woman wraps food in newspapers and brings it over to their table.
SOMEONE<Pete> buttons up next to another escapee.
SOMEONE<Red> puts out a cigarette.
Outside, SOMEONE<Dillinger> walks alone. Without his overcoat, he wears a black vest and a leather gun holster. The woman stops him.
They hold eye contact, and she lets go. As SOMEONE<Dillinger> turns and walks away from the farmhouse, the woman continues to gaze after him. A little boy in overalls comes up and takes her hand. Together, they wander a few steps without taking their eyes off of him. Now in the car as SOMEONE<Red> drives, SOMEONE<Dillinger> looks back at SOMEONE<Pete>.
He faces forward and glances at SOMEONE<Red>.
Now, a man in a blue suit hurries through lush green woods with a SOMEONE<Tommy> gun. He trips, then climbs to his feet and runs on. A clean-cut man wearing suspenders swiftly moves after him toting a rifle. A group of armed lawmen follow behind, charging up a hill.

Later, SOMEONE<Billie> and SOMEONE<Dillinger> stride through the club's foyer.
A gust of wind, SOMEONE turns her to face him.
Her coat over her shoulders.
And continues down the sidewalk with his jacket and arm around her.
Later in an elegant restaurant, SOMEONE<Billie> uneasily scans her surroundings, then looks to SOMEONE<Dillinger>. She smiles, the glances at a female diner. The snobbish woman gives her the eye.
SOMEONE's<Billie's> smile briefly falters.
He flashes an amused smile and sits back.

He gets SOMEONE's<Billie's> coat.
He holds her coat open. SOMEONE<Billie> eyes it, then looks to a staring co-worker.
With a coy smirk, she steps out from behind the counter and slips into her coat. Now in an apartment, a hand drops a rabbit's foot key chain by a tabletop sculpture of two racing greyhounds.

SOMEONE<Dillinger> allows a subdued smile then shifts boyishly in his seat. SOMEONE<Billie> removes the lid, finding forest green tissue paper over the contents. Folding back the layer, she finds a camel hair coat with a thick fur collar. SOMEONE<Billie> lifts the present from its box, staring at it. She swallows, then raises her tender gaze to meet SOMEONE's<Dillinger's>.
Her full lips curl into a smile and the crime boss grins. They gaze into each other's eyes.
Later on a bed, they smother each other with kisses.
Her head, revealing a silvery blue slip, then leans over on top of SOMEONE<Dillinger>. Glimpses of SOMEONE<Dillinger> thrusting into SOMEONE<Billie> from behind interspersed with their nuzzling face-to-face.
A recent flashback shows them writhing ecstatically.
Another flash shows SOMEONE<Dillinger> kiss her mouth. His face withdraws down her chest. Later as they cuddle, they share a warm smile. Later still, SOMEONE<Billie> strolls in her slip to a window seat. Open suitcases occupy every inch, filled to the brim with neatly packed clothes. SOMEONE<Billie> caresses their contents, then rejoins SOMEONE<Dillinger> in bed.
She lays her head on his shoulder. Rolling over to face her, he strokes her cheek and neck.
His thumb gently rubs her graceful jawline.

SOMEONE<Purvis> leads him across the street to a tawny white apartment building. Inside, they enter a long, dim hallway. SOMEONE<Purvis> leads Agent Barton to a door, then readies his hand on his gun. We watch the agents from afar as they prepare, the lengthy corridor dwarfing their trench-coated forms. SOMEONE<Purvis> lifts his knuckles to the door.
It opens, revealing a young woman in a demure house dress, her strawberry blonde hair frames her face in a curly SOMEONE<bob>.

Pushing one open, he peeks into a bathroom. SOMEONE<Billie> sits nude in the tub. As he opens the door all the way, she seductively slides her hands up the porcelain, out of the water, then lifts one shapely leg and caresses the tub's rim with her foot.

Behind them, an L train glides across a bridge, its interior lights glowing in the darkness. Daytime. A tan car pulls to a stop, and SOMEONE<Dillinger> and SOMEONE<Red> climb out. As SOMEONE<Dillinger> heads around the corner down an icy walkway, SOMEONE<Sport> steps out of the safe house.

Now, the car speeds down an empty road lined with tall evergreens that just into the pale blue sky. Golden sunlight shines on its sleek exterior, reflecting the snow-covered ground bordering the woods. SOMEONE<Dillinger> sits in the backseat, the wind from the open windows blowing against his disheveled hair.
In the front passenger seat, Homer stares distantly. Behind him, SOMEONE<Dillinger> drinks from a flask as SOMEONE<Red> administers an injection into his shoulder wound.

Now in a field office, SOMEONE<Purvis> faces his agents.
SOMEONE<Billie> checks her watch then turns up a radio, windows behind her show the passing train.
SOMEONE<Billie> crosses the roomy rundown apartment then doubles back to a door. A woman with similar short hair comes down a staircase, hands SOMEONE<Billie> a large, brown paper bag, and follows her into the apartment. As SOMEONE<Billie> dons her fur-collared coat, the newcomer takes SOMEONE's<Billie's> seat by the radio. The woman wears a top similar to SOMEONE's<Billie's>. As she skims a newspaper and turns up the radio, another elevated train passes in the windows.
G-Men watch the apartment.
In another car, two more agents see someone in an overcoat and fedora totting a paper bag across a dark alley.
The stranger ducks down a narrow passage and reaches out with a delicate hand to a brick wall. It's SOMEONE<Billie> in disguise.
She comes to a street on the other end. Carrying the brown paper bag, she steps off the sidewalk between parked cars and looks around in the middle of the street.
A car's headlights illuminate and shine on her anxious face. Situated about a block away, the car approaches and comes to a stop.
Her head on his shoulder.
The agents abruptly gaze out the door.
SOMEONE<Purvis> steps forward, arms folded across his chest.
In the outer office, the solemn burly agent stands with his partner. As SOMEONE<Purvis> gazes at them, his eyes water and he works his lips.
SOMEONE<Nitti> listens to the radio.
And lists a phone number. As an agent stands by, two female operators work an adjacent switchboard. Now outside on a moonlit shoreline, SOMEONE<Dillinger> sits by a sleeping SOMEONE<Billie>.
Her hair hangs in her face.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> gazes at her and brushes her dark hair aside to reveal her big eyes.
She briefly lowers her gaze.
She smiles.
Turn in his arms.
Horizon sprawls perfectly flat between the sand and black sky.
Daytime. SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> car parks on a street.
Street between passing vehicles.
She enters the building. In the car, SOMEONE<Dillinger> faces the side mirror and brushes his bangs off his forehead. Inside, SOMEONE<Billie> passes through another doorway and SOMEONE'<Purvis'> men grab her.
Uncomfortably glances at the agents.
Outside, SOMEONE<Dillinger> waits in the car.
More armed agents exit a building directly in front of him.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> glares into his side view mirror, then gets out of the car.
The two lovers make eye contact.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> steps forward with a pistol in hand.
Burly agent pushes SOMEONE<Billie> into the backseat and gets in next to her. As they drive away, SOMEONE<Billie> peers through the back window seating between two agents.
A shocked SOMEONE<Dillinger> stands out in the open watching the car drive off. Several armed agents remain behind who strides around a parked car.
He calmly bows his head and collects his breath.
SOMEONE<who> sits in a chair. SOMEONE stands behind him.
She slouches, her left cheek bruised.
He grabs her chin.
He flings her head to the side and stands upright. The interrogator steps out of the room.
SOMEONE<Billie> trembles, her right hand cuffed to the chair. She holds her knees together.
In the outer office, the burly agent downs a paper cup of water and passes Doris who glares at him as he returns to the interrogation room.
Now, the interrogator returns, shuts the door, and eyes SOMEONE<Billie>.
He crosses to her and grabs her chin again.
He grabs her chin.
He shakes her.
SOMEONE's<Billie's> mouth hangs open and she shudders.
Her lips tremble as she finds words.
Office, the interrogator points to Doris.
She holds a telephone at her shoulder.
He puts on his jacket.
Things and move out. Doris dials a telephone.
Agents run up a stairwell. Standing outside an apartment door, one shoots the top and bottom hinges.
Through an open window. The place is empty. The burly agent stiffens his jaw.
Now back in the interrogation room, SOMEONE<Billie> sits with her head down. The two agents barge in. The burly one grabs a phone book.
She keeps her head down and looks directly at him.
As SOMEONE<Purvis> enters the field office, Doris approaches.
In the interrogation room.
She lowers her head and wipes her mouth. The interrogator glares down at her and tensely wipes his mouth. SOMEONE<Billie> looks him in the eye.
He sneers and winds up with his fist. SOMEONE<Winstead> intercepts his arm and slams him
He uncuffs SOMEONE's<Billie's> right arm from the chair.
As she holds her wrists, SOMEONE<Purvis> leans over to her.
He stands upright. SOMEONE<Billie> presses down on the arms of the chair to get up, then stops.
SOMEONE<Purvis> glances at the other interrogator, then lifts SOMEONE<Billie> from the chair and carries her out. In the hall, the rest of the agents stand aside as he passes with the weakened woman. In the interrogation room, SOMEONE<Winstead> lowers his arm from the burly agent's throat and leaves. Now, SOMEONE<Purvis> nods to Doris.
In the interrogation room, the burly agent stays put beside the open door out of the sight line of his peers who's staring.
SOMEONE<Marty> dials a payphone.
In his home, SOMEONE<Nitti> answers.
Now, a woman sits at a bar. A door opens across the room.
SOMEONE<Marty> enters and takes a seat next to her.
Her weary gaze hangs straight ahead, then she looks directly at SOMEONE<Marty>.
He takes her hand and gazes into her eyes.
They pick up their drinks and share another glance.
They both sip.
Now at night, a lake reflects city lights. SOMEONE<Marty> leads SOMEONE<Anna> to a car.
She gets in back and gazes at the unseen driver.
SOMEONE<Purvis> seats at the wheel.
SOMEONE<Anna> averts her gaze. SOMEONE<Purvis> stares at the helpless informant.
Gets out of the car. SOMEONE'<Purvis'> gaze follows her as she walks around his vehicle.
He wears a straw boater hat and sports a trim mustache. He steps out to meet SOMEONE<Piquett> and they sit on a roadside park bench.
SOMEONE<Piquett> reaches into his coat.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> unfolds the page to reveal a handwritten message. Dear SOMEONE<John>, don't try and break me out. I'm too well-guarded. Two years is not a long time anyway. Go someplace safe and wait for me. We will be together again. Your true love in life, SOMEONE<Billie>.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> folds up the note.
Stands and walks away. SOMEONE<Piquett> puts on his hat and heads off in the opposite direction.
Now at a stone wall, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and other men look down at an idling steam locomotive.
Now, SOMEONE<Anna> sits at a kitchen table fanning herself with a magazine.
He crosses the room. SOMEONE's<Anna's> fanning motion slows as her knowing gaze follows him.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> glances around the living room, then returns to the kitchen. He goes to the sink and washes his hands.
SOMEONE<Anna> glances at a door.
He dries his hands with a towel and leads the way through the house to the front door. They leave and our view returns to SOMEONE<Anna> who remains at the table covering her mouth with her hand.
Now, SOMEONE<Madala> crosses the field office to SOMEONE<Purvis> who sits on a desk.
As he eagerly takes the call.
As he listens, SOMEONE<Winstead> looks up from a newspaper. SOMEONE<Purvis> lowers the phone and turns to his peers.
The agents gather.
All eyes turn to SOMEONE<Winstead>.
He checks a newspaper.
Now, SOMEONE<Dillinger> pulls up to a building with Polly.
Above the entrance, he sees the sign for the Chicago Police Department.
They enter the building through a set of double doors.
She goes off and SOMEONE<Dillinger> steps forward, casually chewing gum as he glances around.
An elevator door opens and SOMEONE<Dillinger> steps aboard among a few other men, including a uniformed officer. He glances at the elevator operator and the door glides shut.
On another floor, SOMEONE<Dillinger> crosses a hall to a door bearing the words Detective Bureau SOMEONE<Dillinger> Squad. He enters the quiet office, passing a row of empty chairs against the wall of a waiting area. Daylight shines in through a window.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> hikes up his pants as he enters the main office.
He turns to a bulletin board where multiple mugshots of familiar criminals hang posted.
He crosses to a desk and halts briefly by a secretary busy typing.
A couple of yards ahead, an agent on the phone sits at his desk, unaware of SOMEONE's
presence. The gangster finds another bulletin board and scans its postings. A mugshot of Homer, photos of a robbed bank and a sprawled body, and a street map. A smile crosses SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> lips as he passes through a brilliant shot of sunlight. Further along the bulletin board, he finds black and white photos of himself - others show more buildings. SOMEONE<Dillinger> lowers his sunglasses and views photos of the Little Bohemia Lodge, the wrecked Ford, and a pair of confiscated SOMEONE<Tommy> guns. Now, he crosses to a bulletin board showing mugshots of SOMEONE<Billie>. One is ink-stamped with the words In Custody. SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> gaze roves down a line of mugshots showing Makley, SOMEONE<Pete>, SOMEONE<Tommy>, Homer, SOMEONE<Red>, Gil, and Youngblood, all stamped with the word Deceased. The last mugshot of SOMEONE<Dillinger> himself remains unstamped. SOMEONE<Dillinger> lowers his shades and meets his mugshot's stern gaze.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> rounds a corner and spies a group of agents surround the radio.
One man glances over.
Unrecognized, SOMEONE<Dillinger> moves on.
In a cinema lobby, using a public phone, a fair-haired agent scans his surroundings.
using a public phone, a fair-haired agent scans his surroundings.
Another agent ends the call. Gazing across the street, he shakes his head. A marquee reads Biograph Manhattan Melodrama.
At the wheel of a parked car, SOMEONE<Madala> looks to SOMEONE<Purvis> seated shotgun. Now, by a lamp's modest light, a shaving kit lies open on a small round table. A handgun lies beside it. Facing a mirror, SOMEONE<Dillinger> drags a razor down his lathered cheek.
He finishes shaving and opens his pocket watch, eyeing SOMEONE's<Billie's> photo and the time.
He shuts the watch, puts it away, and pockets the gun.
Parked near the Biograph, SOMEONE<Purvis> tensely rubs his thin-lipped mouth. At the box office, a few anonymous patrons mill into the theater. The agent looks away, shifting his anxious gaze.
He gets out of the car and paces down the sidewalk.
He stops, turns, and puts his back to the cinema. Behind him, a man arrives with two blonde women, one of them in a conspicuous orange skirt.
SOMEONE<Purvis> blinks, then looks over his shoulder. Spotting the trio, he looks away. Across the street, SOMEONE<Dillinger> accompanies the two women into the cinema, passing a Manhattan Melodrama poster. Entering the packed house, the crime boss leaves SOMEONE<Anna> at a seat, then proceeds down the aisle with Polly. They find adjacent seats as opening titles appear on the screen featuring the stars' pictures. They read Clark Gable, SOMEONE<William> Powell, Manhattan Melodrama. In the packed audience, SOMEONE<Dillinger> stares intently at the screen through his spectacles.
Outside, SOMEONE<Purvis> addresses his agents.
SOMEONE<Purvis> pats SOMEONE's<Winstead's> shoulder.
The team splits up.
In the movie house, the crowd watches figures on screen playing hockey, then Clark Gable washing his hands in a men's room. Another character walks in.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> gazes at the screen with a boyish smirk.
Sitting in her own, SOMEONE<Anna> turns, peeking nervously over her shoulder. She faces the screen again, her chest heaving. Outside, the agents take their positions, SOMEONE<Winstead> and Hurt ducking to a storefront's recessed entryway. In the movie house, SOMEONE<Dillinger> watches the screen with a furrowed brow.
Leading lady Myrna Loy stares with her mouth agape. SOMEONE<Dillinger> gazes at her with a knitted brow and clenched jaw. In a fur-collared coat, the exotically pretty actress wears a pensive expression. Later, she shifts her sober gaze. Later still, she turns away from a door, clad in black. Taking a deep breath, she manages a brave nod.
Blinking back tears, she opens the door and hurries out. Clark Gable stares after her. SOMEONE<Dillinger> watches with shining eyes. Outside, SOMEONE<Purvis> checks his watch. Posted near the box office, he looks across the street. SOMEONE<Winstead> and Hurt wait patiently in the recessed storefront. SOMEONE<Purvis> turns, gazing toward the cinema lobby.
On the movie screen, Clark Gable faces SOMEONE<William> Powell. He dons a cocky smile.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> watches with a defiant smirk. Onscreen, Gable turns away from Powell who draws a deep breath and heads into a cell block. A guard follows, closes a prison door, and locks it. Outside the theater, SOMEONE<Purvis> digs a box of matches from his pocket and takes one out. From his breast pocket, he produces a cigar and holds it ready. On the movie screen, Gable makes his way down the cell block flanked by guards.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> wears a faint sad smile as Gable faces a fellow convict.
SOMEONE<Dillinger> wears a faint half-smile, his eyes shining.
Outside, SOMEONE<Purvis> shifts his tense, vigilant gaze.
In the movie house, words on the screen read The End. The patrons stand, filing out of their rows.
A few rows down, SOMEONE<Dillinger> stands with Polly and SOMEONE<don> his straw hat.
Outside, SOMEONE<Purvis> watches the exit.
At the storefront, SOMEONE<Winstead> stand ready. In the parked car, the burly agent sweats at the wheel. His right hand trembles severely and he uses his left to steady it. Near the cinema door, SOMEONE<Purvis> watches movie patrons exiting the lobby. He faces the street, strikes the match, and lights his cigar.
With a hostile sneer, the burly agent rushes out of the car. Now, SOMEONE<Dillinger> steps into plain view walking between SOMEONE<Anna> and Polly.
Younger friend wears a carefree grin. Keeping apace.
A bystander aside, SOMEONE<Purvis> heads down the sidewalk after them.
Burly agent joins the flow of foot traffic with his gun raised. SOMEONE<Zarkovich> notices and roughly
Across the street, SOMEONE<Winstead> and Hurt leave the recessed storefront.
Agent scowls, holding his aim as he gains on the crime boss.
To his cheek, spewing blood and tissue. Two crimson stains bloom on his shirt front as Hurt fires twice from behind. SOMEONE<Dillinger> falls face down, eyes staring off as blood streams from his ruptured cheek. SOMEONE<Purvis> stares, then ventures forward. As SOMEONE<Dillinger> lies dying, his lips move.
SOMEONE<Winstead> removes his hat, crouches, and leans his ear close to SOMEONE<Dillinger>.
The agent narrows his eye, glances at the fallen man, and withdraws, revealing SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> lifeless stare.
SOMEONE<Winstead> gets to his feet, his sober gaze locked on the dead man.
He holsters his gun and SOMEONE<Purvis> joins his side. As the younger G-Man eyes the body, SOMEONE<Winstead> dons his hat, his stare stoic and grim.
The older man faces him.
SOMEONE<Purvis> eyes him long and steady. SOMEONE<Winstead> glances away, then looks SOMEONE<Purvis> in the eye. SOMEONE<Marty> leans in for a good look at SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> body, then heads off. Polly averts her gaze.
SOMEONE<Winstead> lights a cigarette and pensively looks away. More onlookers converge on the scene.
Flare's subtle light.
Clad in a simple gray dress, she wears a dull expression. As the matron ushers her to another, the prisoner
maintains her dispassionate gaze. In the visiting room, the door opens. SOMEONE<Winstead> stands as SOMEONE<Billie> enters. She stares guardedly at him, then takes the seat facing his.
SOMEONE<Winstead> sits. Leaning forward, he faces her with a knitted brow.
SOMEONE<Billie> swallows, blinks her glistening eyes, then gives a stony nod.
SOMEONE<Billie> glares coldly. SOMEONE<Winstead> opens a gold cigarette case and briefly thumbs the contents. He turns the case, offering the grieving woman a cigarette. She sneers.
Instead pockets the cigarette case.
The agent stares solemnly.
SOMEONE<Billie> narrows her eyes.
Her defiant sneer fades.
Meeting SOMEONE's<Winstead's> gaze, she gives a nod.
Eyes closed, SOMEONE<Billie> slowly shakes her head and takes a deep breath.
Young woman gazes off with a solemn

As they pass the South Korean soldiers at the raised barricade, she blinks tearfully. The unshaven man takes a step forward his expression inscrutable.
She strides toward the civilian who stares anxiously at her injured face. Jagged geometric pieces of the image separate from each other like shards of glass. The central pieces slide together and form a title as the picture around them fades to black. Salt. Now pedestrians pass a high-rise apartment building. Words appear, Washington D.C. present day. In an apartment, the civilian works at a kitchen table, his cheeks now smoothly shaven. A scruffy dog yawns in a dog bed behind him. The blonde peeks at the man from around the doorway.

And brutally with the blade. Meanwhile.
SOMEONE paces in the interrogation room.
In the hallway.

With her as she anxiously taps her phone against her hand.
With her back to the door, she sits on the edge of the table. A flashing red light pulses through the window from the hallway.

A monitor shows SOMEONE in the hallway.

SOMEONE heads into a room with the fire extinguisher and some bottles of cleaning solutions.
SOMEONE opens a janitorial closet and removes a bottle from a cabinet. As the overhead lights flicker on, she glances up at a camera. She slides off her panties and uses them to cover its lens. Then tips over a table and unscrews one of its metal legs. Meanwhile, SOMEONE reads her file.

He hands her SOMEONE's book on Spiders.
To the high-rise.
Now inside the building, an elevator's door slide open and SOMEONE peeks into a hallway. She scurries to her apartment door where she slides a hidden key from the frame.

She carries them in her hands as she searches the apartment.
She passes a framed photo of the couple embracing.
Her gaze swivels from a hallway to the vacant living room.
SOMEONE runs over and she pats him.

Using a bust statuette, he knocks away the remaining glass. On the wall just outside, SOMEONE climbs.
She grabs an air conditioning unit and crosses to its other side. As SOMEONE leans out the window.
Presses her back to the wall, hiding behind the air conditioner. He sweeps his gaze over the U-shaped courtyard then looks to the ground roughly ten stories below.
Stretches her leg across a cornered gap to another windowsill. Hugging the wall, she sidesteps to the next window. Her toes deftly feeling for its latch.
Now she reaches a window of a fire escape. Peeking inside, she sees a young girl in headphones doing homework at a table.
SOMEONE waves at her oblivious neighbor. As the young girl shifts her gaze, she notices the woman outside and returns the wave. SOMEONE beckons and the girl heads over.
She puts a pair of jeans on under her skirt.
Her friendly smile fades as SOMEONE catches her gaze. Staring at the dog, she remembers a butterfly soaring over SOMEONE's head in a pavilion filled with lush vegetation. He approaches a wandering SOMEONE.
He wears a mild boyish smile.
Later, he shows her a bulbous black spider resting in a glass-encased web.
Donning glasses, SOMEONE peers excitedly at the spider.
SOMEONE smiles, watching the spider pick its way up to a twig housing its web.
Back in the present, she walks down a sidewalk, a knit cap pulled over her hair. Leaving her building, SOMEONE spots her.
SOMEONE sprints away.
SOMEONE reaches a subway entrance and dashes down an escalator.
Then halts at the side of an SUV.
Now draws his gun and pursues SOMEONE on foot.
As another SUV arrives
On a trailer of a passing semi with a hard bounce.
SOMEONE, as he fires again.
And two officers get out.
Pulls herself up to a stable position then crouches and gets her bearing.

In the SUV, SOMEONE takes a few steadying breaths.
SOMEONE gets a text.
Evelyn SOMEONE was injured during the Moscow car crash that killed her parents.
In the bathroom, SOMEONE kicks a feminine hygiene product dispenser off the wall. It opens as it lands and she takes a pad. Facing a mirror, she unwraps it. Then lifts her bloodstained shirt to reveal a gunshot wound at the top of her hip. She applies the pad to the injury then tucks it into her waistband. Shutting her eyes, she remembers lying on top of SOMEONE in bed. They kiss and wrestle playfully.
Inside, SOMEONE watches a newscast.
She remembers riding in the back of an SUV in Korea with SOMEONE's concerned gaze fixed on her.
She faces him, revealing her bruised swollen eye.

She woefully meets his gaze.
SOMEONE gives a loving smile. Beaming tearfully, SOMEONE rests her head against her folded hands. SOMEONE holds her by the crook of her elbow. Taking his hand, she presses her lips to it. SOMEONE leans close and kisses the top of her blonde head. Back in the present, SOMEONE shifts her listless gaze. Now at a hotel's check-in desk.
On a hallway, the housekeeping woman removes garments from a rack of laundered clothes and takes them into a guest's room.
Passing the rack, SOMEONE snatches a garment in each hand without breaking her stride. Now she arrives at her deluxe room with the clothes draped over her arm.
Depositing her backpack on the bed, she moves through the space, examining it with a keen perceptive gaze. She peers into a bathroom then returns to the bedroom and removes her knit cap.
SOMEONE retrieves a jewelry box from a plastic bag containing cash and passports. She removes a set of false teeth from her mouth then takes out a pair of darkly tinted contact lenses from her pale blue eyes.
Now she lays out an assortment of handguns,
ammunition and hardware on the bed.
She presses a button on the square component and a red light illuminates.
Later SOMEONE uses a needle to draw clear venom from the spider. By her open laptop, a printer ejects a page headed, Subway System Access Tunnels. A blueprint reads Detail: St. SOMEONE Subdivision, and highlights a steam vent. Nearby, another print out bares the heading, Church Tunnels. SOMEONE crosses to a window, pulls the drapes aside a few inches and peers out. St. Bartholomew's Cathedral stands almost directly across the street, softly illuminated by outdoor flood lamps. Gazing wistfully at it, SOMEONE remembers swearing in as a CIA agent.
Back in the present, she dyes her hair dark. Daytime, rooftop secret service snipers monitor a funeral procession.
Across the street, a woman with dark brown hair looks on. As we revolve around her, we recognize SOMEONE's high cheekbones and bee-stung lips. At the cathedral entrance, SOMEONE stands between SOMEONE and a balding man. At the curb, a secret service agent opens a car door. Matveyev gets out and solemnly looks around. SOMEONE watches him proceed toward the entrance, flanked by a secret service detail.
She steps away. Matveyev pauses, casting about his weary gaze.
SOMEONE moves through the crowd, keeping an eye on him. From the church entrance, SOMEONE catches a glimpse of her. He narrows his eyes, trying to get a better look but she slips out of view.
The military dress uniforms carry a flag draped casket.
They bring the coffin to the church's entry way. Matveyev follows, flanked by his security.
And speeds through a subway tunnel. On board, a female police officer turns.
The fugitive pretends to read a folded newspaper.
SOMEONE drops the newspaper by the door and moves away as it smolders.
Now in the cathedral, a gray-haired man plays an organ. In front of him, dozens of men and women in the choir wear white robes and hold songbooks as they sing soberly.
In the congregation, Matveyev greets a middle-aged woman with auburn hair.
He approaches a lanky man in a row behind her.
The commander-in-chief moves aside, Matveyev sidles into his row and nods at the first lady.
He eases past her and stands at her side. At the front of the cathedral, the flag draped casket lies before the apse. In front of it, a soldier in dress uniform ends a salute and marches away.
The congregation and choir take their seats. The U.S. president kisses his wife then treads forward and tenderly lays his hand on the casket. On a mezzanine balcony, SOMEONE gazes down on the nave as the president moves toward a podium.
SOMEONE watches from a security hub in the sacristy.
He peers into the nave.
SOMEONE radios in.
SOMEONE jogs through an access tunnel with a low ceiling. In the cathedral.
As the steam fills a chamber beneath her, she reaches a door and peeks through its window into a hallway. Two security agents enter from another door.
He back down. His partner attacks once more but SOMEONE kicks him unconscious and runs off with his gun. Now Matveyev takes the podium. In a stairwell, SOMEONE dashes up several flights.
In the crypt, a door cracks open and SOMEONE peeks out. She aims a tiny mirror down the hallway and spots a security agent striding up. As the man reaches for his gun, the door swings open and SOMEONE leaps out. She boots him backward. Knees the weapon out of his hand.
Crouching, SOMEONE fires through the downed man, using him like a silencer.
Nails the approaching agent in his bulletproof vest.
Shoots another mechanism. In the cathedral, guests panic. Meanwhile, SOMEONE draws his gun. In the crypt chamber, SOMEONE attaches one of the detonator components to a brick of explosives. She tosses it upward and it magnetically adheres to a chandelier's base on the ceiling. In the mezzanine, SOMEONE radios in.
In the crypt, SOMEONE shines his flashlight at a dead guard. A cloud of dust fills the hallway ahead. Now in the smoke-filled organ chamber.
SOMEONE aims her gun through the cloud of dust and faintly glimpses Matveyev's form. She shoots him. In the hallway.
SOMEONE reacts to the sound and moves toward it. In the organ chamber, his flashlight glows through the dust. Its wavering beam glares brighter and
Her calm aim, hold steady.
She raises her hands, aiming the gun harmlessly at the ceiling then lets it drop.
Other agents enter.
A supervisor radios in.
Later outside.
He uses his cell.
The two men lock gazes. SOMEONE glances quizzically after SOMEONE and heaves a sigh. Now the three vehicle police convoy moves down a vacant city street. Later, it crosses the 59th Street Bridge. In the back seat, SOMEONE blinks.
Eyes. The lead cruiser veers to one side and passes a U-Haul truck.
SOMEONE tips her head back and studies the cruiser behind him in a rear view mirror.
In a flashback.
A girl enters a dormitory.
Bandages conceal her features.
She climbs into a bed next to SOMEONE's.
Moonlight glows on his scarred cheek.
One ramming his head into the window.
SOMEONE winces, bracing herself.
The SUV tips and smashes down onto all four wheels. Inside, SOMEONE steals a key ring from the driver's belt. Bystanders tread toward the passenger side of the SUV as SOMEONE slips out the driver's side. As two men rush to help the driver, she hides and unlocks the handcuffs. Later, she strides casually away with her hands in her pockets.
As the sleeper agent sunders pass the sidewalk vendor's hat rack, she steals an ushanka-style fur cap. Later, clouds fill the bright afternoon sky. Passengers sit calmly on a ferry.
And her shoulders wrapped in a knee length fur lined shawl. Sunlight flares on the misty air, starkly outlining her profile against the sea and the sky.
Bandages still cover much of her swollen face.
Young SOMEONE halts on his way out and she kisses his ring.
He hurries off down a long corridor. As the young girl stares longingly after him, a smooth featured man strides up.
Back in the present, SOMEONE stares off over the water. Later, the passengers file off the ferry, past a TV showing a newscast.
In a junkyard.
SOMEONE and others watch TV.
Give her a warm embrace. SOMEONE strokes SOMEONE's cheek.
She kisses his ring. Cradling his hand and both of hers, she takes a stroll with him across the salvage yard.
They hug again.
Is around a floating barrel and angles toward a boxy barge. A henchman wielding a rifle stands guard on its deck. SOMEONE studies him coolly.
SOMEONE beams. As SOMEONE leads her across a catwalk, her smile falters. She surveys some men working at a table beneath them.
He gestures her forward.
With a warm smile, SOMEONE proceeds down a set of stairs. Her Russian mentor follows close behind.
Reaching a dimly lit corridor, SOMEONE turns to find two thugs lifting a large circular hatch on the floor.
Her cool smile gone she ventures further in. SOMEONE trails his former protégée, observing her closely. The thugs step aside from the raised hatch. As SOMEONE peers down through the opening, a flashlight turns on to reveal SOMEONE bound with a chain.
A crimson rag gags his mouth. As SOMEONE stares at her husband, SOMEONE steps up beside her, scrutinizing her response. SOMEONE gazes up at her. His gray eyes wide. SOMEONE maintains her stony expression.
SOMEONE mashes his teeth around his gag as he stares pleadingly at his wife. She faces SOMEONE and her bee-stung lips curl into a cold smile.
A thug aims his rifle at her.
As SOMEONE turns away, her smile fades.
And then turns, a guard wrenches a valve.
Watching her husband's head thrash, SOMEONE struggles to fight back tears welling in her eyes.
She looks up at a guard in a suit, aiming a handgun at her. Blinking, she clears her eyes and faces SOMEONE without a hint of grief.
They drink their vodka.
To our family, sister. The man beside him nods to her.
In a flashback, SOMEONE glimpses young boys dressed in identical stripe shirts. Back in the present, SOMEONE escorts her into a radio room.
Some more vodka.
He marks a map.
Rams over and over. SOMEONE's head slips forward and the bloody bottle drops to the floor. SOMEONE's gaze darts.
She strides across the room and opens several cases of weapons. Then slaps a click into the butt of a handgun.
Falls dead beside his wounded comrade in a suit. As the terrified survivor struggles to crawl away, SOMEONE moves over him.
With gun, the man convulses then falls limp. SOMEONE turns away with a stony expression. Holding her gun at a ready, she steps to the edge of the stairwell. She checks a corridor for survivors then drops her gaze downstairs.
A dozen charred victims killed in the grenade blast lie in heaps around the open hatch.
SOMEONE's gaze softens. She stares at the dark shimmering water flooding the chamber below.
Her glistening eyes stare wistfully. In a flashback, SOMEONE wears a bridal veil. She giggles and buries her face against the shoulder of SOMEONE's neatly pressed suit.
Man in dress uniform steps up to SOMEONE.
She stares at him blankly.
She recalls the young boy with the scar on his cheek lying in the bed next to hers.
The man shows his scarred cheek.
In a seat facing her.
He hands her a badge.
He shows a blueprint.
SOMEONE holds her palms together as he cups her hands in his.
She locks eyes with him impassively. Nighttime. An aerial view shows the lights of Washington D.C. glowing around the dome of the capital building. Now SOMEONE drives an SUV up to a checkpoint, a guard hurries over.
One show SOMEONE with his alias, the other a young man named SOMEONE.
SOMEONE turns and lifts his arms.
The security agent runs a detection wand over him then lets him through.
SOMEONE watches her wave the wand over his colleague.
SOMEONE turns revealing his soft features and bee-stung lips. The impostor grabs her service cap and attaché case from a security conveyor belt then walks beside SOMEONE.
With the president.
The group boards an elevator. Back with the others.
As the adviser heads to the elevator, SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE.
Later, SOMEONE throw SOMEONE to the floor.
The closing elevator doors, SOMEONE spies SOMEONE in her disguise. SOMEONE presses a remote then explodes.
In the hall. In the elevator.
In a smoke-filled hallway, SOMEONE rolls over and pushes herself onto her knees.
She grabs a set of keys and a gun off a fallen agent then hurries upstairs.
Adding herself in a room, she tears off her jacket.
SOMEONE shifts his eyes thoughtfully.
SOMEONE removes her false ears.
She rips it away from her nose and mouth. Back in the elevator.
The group hurries down a hall.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE sneaks downstairs.
The agent uses his radio.
Meanwhile hiding against the wall by the stairs, SOMEONE peers around the corner and sees a tactical team shuffling pass. Back with the president.
Agents hurry the president down a hall. SOMEONE sprints along at another.
Turning a corner, the president and his men approach an elevator.
They rush inside.
A guard station in the hall.
She pries the doors open and peers down into the shaft of the descending car. Her gaze sweeps to the metal framework along the walls and she leaps onto a crossbar.
Then jumps to a lower beam in the opposite corner. Continuing in this manner, she gradually descends floor by floor.
SOMEONE glances toward the ceiling.
An agent checks the entryway.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE tightrope-walks along the beam in the elevator shaft. At the bunker door.
In the shaft, SOMEONE sees two parallel rails running down a wall. Squeezing between them, she slides down like an elevator on its tracks. In the bunker corridor.
SOMEONE reaches the bottom of the shaft. Now the heavily reinforced bunker door swings open.
He addresses a bunker guard.
As the president and his entourage walk through the doorway, the guard enters a code on a keypad.
Using the stolen ID card, she unlocks the gate. Meanwhile.
The president and his men head to the emergency operation center. With them, a military aide carries a briefcase, its handle tethered to his wrist.
Satellite images appear.
The military aide sets his briefcase on the table.
And opens it and presses his thumb on a fingerprint scanner inside.
Back in the emergency operation center.
Secret service agent James joins a woman wearing a headset.
Enters a code on the control pad.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE hurries down a corridor. As two agents draw closer, she charges. She barrels one over then punches the other.
The first agent slams her.
The first agent and he falls. As he reaches for his gun
He knocks down the other agent as well. In the operation center, the scanner verifies the President's palm print. The Secretary of Defense holds a phone receiver in each hand. At the Pentagon, military officials watch a news report.
A general picks up a red handled phone. Meanwhile, the Secretary
Of Defense hands one receiver to the president and the other to military aide.
He sits and types on his computer
Code matches the general's.
The general hangs up.
In the bunker with a two dead agents. Now Jenks turns to the lead bunker officer.
Through a doorway, they see Officer Dryers body fall to the ground.
SOMEONE steps away from it.
The President gapes. Outside the operation center, SOMEONE shifts her eyes. Back inside, SOMEONE aims his gun at the President.
He lowers himself into a chair. His eyes wide.
Over the table and SOMEONE shoots her. Meanwhile, SOMEONE approaches the room.
SOMEONE shoots him. Peering through a window, SOMEONE sees the commander-in-chief fall out of his chair. As SOMEONE removes his jacket, SOMEONE's gaze scans the room and takes in the dead body sprawled behind a control counter.
SOMEONE settles into a seat at the nuclear warfare computer.
SOMEONE presses a button on the wall intercom. Her eyes focused on her old colleague as he types.
He looks over.
SOMEONE smiles at him. He lifts his brow.
On the computer.
Who uses a blowtorch on the reinforced door. Now a status bar shows the authorization reaching 29%.
SOMEONE approaches the window separating him from SOMEONE.
SOMEONE stares into her pleading eyes. His jaws set tightly. Her breath fogs the glass.
A tiny smile touches SOMEONE's lips and he nods. As he turns from the window, he spots a news report on the monitor. A caption underneath footage of Matveyev reads, Russian President alive.
SOMEONE turns back to the window and steps closer. On the other side, SOMEONE stares unapologetically.
He leans his arms against the glass and looks into her eyes.
SOMEONE defiantly lifts her chin.
SOMEONE's lips spread into a smile.
SOMEONE fires a handgun at the bulletproof window.
Her bullets create a cluster of snowflake-like impressions in the glass. She drops her emptied handgun and raises an automatic rifle. As her shots fail to shutter the window, SOMEONE strolls back to the nuclear
Warfare computer.
And smashes the butt of her rifle.
In glass then notices a control pad by the door in the operation center.
She heads down a hall. SOMEONE glances
Into the biometric scanner.
His hand down on the scanning pad.
SOMEONE breaks part of the wall away to reveal an electronic device inside. She removes some wires from it. In the operation center, SOMEONE waits against the wall beside the door with his pistol in hand.
In the operation center.
She sinks to the floor.
SOMEONE marches to the controls. Scrambling to her feet.
A round kick, rushes to the launch controls and types.
Slams her down on the table.
SOMEONE lunges to the launch controls
Tap a link cord. She get shot
SOMEONE lies face down watching tensely.
SOMEONE keeps his weary gaze fixed on SOMEONE. Taking her into custody, an officer yanks down her shirt and finds a bulletproof vest. Later, SOMEONE passes SOMEONE and his men in a corridor.
As SOMEONE gets led past, she jerks her chin up at SOMEONE.
He stares after her. Down the hall.
Now the agents escort SOMEONE of a curving flight of stairs to a landing, where SOMEONE lingers with the SOMEONE.
He slips a pair of scissors from the SOMEONE's bag then locks eyes with SOMEONE.
Secret service agents haul SOMEONE back up.
The agents back SOMEONE against the wall.
They shove her in and then one wraps a blanket around her shoulders.
She finds SOMEONE seated across from her.
Away from the rising helicopter, followed by another chopper
SOMEONE gazes listlessly out the window. Her nose, cheek, and mouth stained with dark blood clots. She sees the Washington Monument pass by. A red light blinking at its apex. SOMEONE studies her with a thoughtful gaze. The helicopters rise high above the city, silhouetted against a rose and indigo sky.
The agents look away uneasily.
The bald man avoids his hostile glare. SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE wearily. Her narrowed eyes glistening. He shifts angrily in his seat. SOMEONE coldly straightens and looks him in the eye.
His chest heaving, SOMEONE shifts his bewildered gaze then looks to SOMEONE again.
SOMEONE looks away. His lips tightly pursed.
He takes out his cell and eyes the display. It reads, Urgent message - fingerprints place SOMEONE on barge where SOMEONE was killed. SOMEONE looks up at the mysterious woman, who watches him with a steady earnest gaze. His brow creased. He puts the cellphone back in his pocket.
SOMEONE lowers his gaze to the handcuff around SOMEONE's wrist restraints. As he looks up at her blood stained face, her eyes glisten and she displays a big smile.
SOMEONE studies her resolute expression.
Craning his neck, he looks pass her to the FBI agents. He glances down again at SOMEONE's restraints then eyes the bald man. He talks on a headset. A window shows their approach over the Potomac River. SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a meaningful look which she registers coldly.
SOMEONE stares at him and he directs her gaze toward the window.
Seeing a river below, she discreetly unbuckles her seat belt. SOMEONE watches her gravely.
His lips screwed tightly. He glances out of the Potomac then directs her gaze to the door. It bears a semi-circular emergency release handle. Swallowing, SOMEONE watches SOMEONE's finger tap deliberately against his leg. She steals herself with a deep breath. As SOMEONE's hand closes into a fist, she lunges for the emergency release.
His brow furrowed. He stares into the water. It shows no sign of the mysterious woman.
Searching fruitlessly for SOMEONE, SOMEONE allows a smile and gives a satisfied nod.
They turn away from the Potomac's rocky bank.
The river's edge, hands caress at a snow blanket of rock as slim figure wades through the knee-deep water. SOMEONE rushes a shore and dashes through the woods, pumping her shackled arms. Leaning briefly against a tree trunk, she glances over her shoulder. She breathes hard through her parted lips. Her wet short hair clinging to her head. Her feet carry her over the forest snowy ground.
She watches SOMEONE's helicopter leaves the Potomac and its bordering wetlands. She ventures onward.
In the cockpit.
Covered valley.
Humongous hole in the Earth.
Inside the cave, a fair-haired man floats in shallow water.
Wearing only a wet suit, he goes through the motions of checking his equipment.
He shakes his head, then lifts it out of the water.
The fair-haired man gently swims across the rocky pool and climbs onto a ledge. A lanky man wearing a climber's helmet sits nearby. He gets up and moves a large backpack.
SOMEONE hands a camera to a goateed guy wearing a Ramones t-shirt.
The goateed guy leaves a canopy-covered station and steps past the two divers.
At the foot of another pool, he sets a shoebox-sized camera into the water.
He leaves the pool and sits behind a computer housed inside an orange plastic case.
Nearby, SOMEONE helps the female diver strap a rebreather to her back.
She gets a reading on a handheld device.
SOMEONE gets up from his station and faces her with his hands on his hips.
She nods.

He looks back at SOMEONE.
He steps off of the edge and falls face down.
About halfway down, SOMEONE catches up with SOMEONE.
Surface, SOMEONE brings SOMEONE another cellphone.
He dives over the edge with open arms and falls into the dark abyss.
He lowers the phone.
It shines in through the distant aperture.
Returns to his work. SOMEONE and SOMEONE look on.
They each continue their descent. At forward base, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE releases Virgil into the pool and the robot sets off after the diver.
He watches them go underwater.
a pale flashlight shines over the darkened rocks as a diver emerges from a narrow passage.
Flap of his swim fins propels the lead diver through the water. SOMEONE follow, shining her flashlight over the rock walls.
A single spotlight shines up from the floor as SOMEONE leads them through the darkened chamber.
At the other base camp, SOMEONE dunks a teabag into a mug.
Seated on a rock, he waits for SOMEONE and SOMEONE to reach the bottom.
Finger and he grins.
Water, SOMEONE detaches an air cylinder from the decompression chamber.
SOMEONE looks back at SOMEONE.
Mask. His shadow appears on the rock wall.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE and SOMEONE rappel down a craggy shaft.
Sitting back in her harness, her feet pressed against the rock wall.
SOMEONE descends another shaft. At forward base, SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a mug while SOMEONE
watches the divers on the monitor.
She eyes a tunnel blocked by a cluster of rocks. As SOMEONE clears the entrance, Virgil lines up behind them.
Last rock and gazes into a dark passageway.
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE watch the monitor. Meanwhile, SOMEONE climbs out of shallow water onto a rock ledge where SOMEONE stands filming a cavern with a video camera.
She sits on the ledge above.
The tusk on a necklace.
SOMEONE unclips his extra oxygen tank and pushes it away.
He struggles through the narrow tunnel.
He follows close behind her, rebreather also removed from her back.
He works a joystick.
He flippers as she struggles forward.
As she pushes her rebreather, its pack snags on a rock.
SOMEONE continues on and SOMEONE follows.
Now in an area enveloped by darkness, a beam of light shines out, its radius growing larger as SOMEONE emerges from the tunnel into a cavern.
A wall below the tunnel. As SOMEONE emerges behind him, SOMEONE anchors a guide line to the cavern wall.
SOMEONE shines a flashlight.
Pointing his finger, he swirls it in a circle.
SOMEONE heads back to the tunnel.
As she sucks in a mouthful of water.
And then her body jerks.
Virgil glides over to SOMEONE who turns, peering out at SOMEONE from the monitor.
He squeezes his eyes shut. SOMEONE watches the monitor with a grave look and SOMEONE shifts his gaze away.
Now, SOMEONE' body floats against the decompression chamber outer wall.
His eyes fixed on his lifeless colleague.
Now at forward base, SOMEONE lugs a rebreather pack ashore as SOMEONE and SOMEONE come out of the water.
Sitting on the rock, the monitor replays SOMEONE's struggle with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE steps into view, his brow creased in anguish.
SOMEONE sees his father standing at the water's edge, his arms cradling SOMEONE limp body.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE lifted on to the rocks.
Above ground, wind bellows through trees and lightning flashes.
Back at forward base, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE under the tent.
SOMEONE tries the radio.
SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a sidelong glance, then sits beside SOMEONE who eats rice from a pot.
SOMEONE turns off the radio.
He sits heavily beside his son, pulls the cork from his tequila bottle, and takes a swig.
With his head bowed, he holds the bottle out to SOMEONE who takes it and drinks.
The young man swallows then lets out a deep breath.
SOMEONE lifts his head but avoids his son's gaze.
SOMEONE clenches his jaw and his nostrils flare. SOMEONE stands.
SOMEONE taps SOMEONE.
Tribal shaman elder lifts his face to the dark sky. Rain pours down on him.
The aerial shows the deluge plummeting into the cave's pitch black mouth.
His feet splashing in muddy water.
And SOMEONE eyes the boar tooth torch around his neck.
He tries to yank it off then glares at it.
As he tugs again.
He tilts his head alertly.
SOMEONE takes the lead.
At forward base, SOMEONE sits in front of the monitor swigging from his bottle. Sweeping his gaze around the cave, he wipes his mouth the back of his hand then picks up a flashlight. He glides his beam up a wall to a crevasse in the rock.
SOMEONE joins him. Sitting in front of the monitor, he eyes the onscreen footage of St. Jude's Cathedral where Virgil's light shines up a towering shaft toward the rippling surface of the air bell.
SOMEONE drinks from the tequila bottle.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE stops at a comm station.
Leaks through cracks, raining into the cave. SOMEONE gazes around.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE look up the shaft with their headlamps.
His companions stare gravely.
SOMEONE looks around.
SOMEONE tearfully bares his teeth.
He looks his son in the eye and gives a small nod.
Looking up, SOMEONE notices the boulder sealing off their exit.
On the upper edge blows out shooting sparks and leaving the falls in darkness.
SOMEONE pants in an agonized SOMEONE. Later, the team arrives back at the dark, flooded base camp.
SOMEONE packs.
SOMEONE rushes to a floating body bag and gently pulls it open to reveal SOMEONE' lifeless face.
SOMEONE watches, He remove the dead woman's wetsuit.
She folds her arms across her chest and stubbornly plants her feet.
SOMEONE gravely looks from her to SOMEONE.
Searching the area for supplies, SOMEONE heads around a large flowstone feature and halts. Two motionless legs float before him.
Pulling him into the light, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE's face pulverized beyond recognition.
The Eye opens.
SOMEONE hurries over.
He crouches by his gravely injured colleague.
SOMEONE queasily turns away.
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE away.
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE back.
The injured man wraps an arm around his friend's shoulder.
Then pushes against his throat. Maintaining his hold, the older man bites his lip.
SOMEONE's hand grabs his shoulder again, flexes weakly, and goes limp.
Now underwater, we peer up at four pairs of legs silhouetted against the light above the surface. There feet clad in flippers, they lazily tread water. Back at the large flowstone feature, SOMEONE crouches over his euthanized friend.
Now we float up toward the lazily kicking legs.
He lowers his goggles.
As their headlamps descend, the cave goes dark.
Now, SOMEONE leads the way through the narrow passage leading to the Devil's Restriction.
SOMEONE swims into view, pulling at the rocks beneath him. His father takes his hand, places it on the guide line, and gives the okay signal. SOMEONE returns the gesture. His father swims on, leading him through the winding passage.
SOMEONE passes the decompression chamber.
From a distance, we watch the team of divers recede into the murky depths.
A light on her rebreather pack glows green.
While SOMEONE soberly looks on. SOMEONE goes next, shoving his gear in before him.
The Restriction and swims in after it. Left alone, SOMEONE worriedly shakes her head and looks away.
SOMEONE's flippered feet paddle out of view.
Effort, she pushes her gear into the restriction.
Ahead, shimmering green light grows visible from around a bend.
Her eyes wide behind her goggles. Up ahead, SOMEONE pushes himself through the exit. His father hovers in St. Jude's Cathedral waiting for him.
Ahead, SOMEONE joins Franks, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE outside the tunnel exit.
With her fists. In the Cathedral, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE worriedly.
The others continue to wait in one line.
Grabs hold and jerks at it. Outside the tunnel, the exit shows no sign of her approach. SOMEONE taps his boss on the shoulder. As SOMEONE faces him, he points at his own eyes then at the restriction. SOMEONE shakes his head, wags a finger, then swims toward the tunnel himself.
A headlamp beam appears from the darkness.
SOMEONE turns to look as SOMEONE crawls into view.
He swims forward. SOMEONE rubs her arm.
Then jerks his thumb upward. Now, a beam of light shines toward the rippling surface of the air bell above.
SOMEONE removes his mouthpiece.
On to the rocky bank, He pulls of an elastic band strapping a flashlight to his arm and turns on his helmet's secondary light.
Drips from his wetsuit as his lamp sweeps over the cavern. With an awestruck smile, he ventures forward.
The pool next and finds the financier wandering out of view.
The young man climbs up on an underwater ledge and raises his flippered feet.
Hiking over a ridge, SOMEONE finds a vast cavernous passageway ascending before him.
Dwarfed to a minuscule size by his surroundings.
And SOMEONE covers her with the metal tissue-thin space blanket.
He sits him down and hands him a rebreather. SOMEONE puts it to his mouth. Stepping away, SOMEONE reaches into his supply pack and pulls out a knife with a six inch blade.
SOMEONE grimly switches off his helmet lamp, so does SOMEONE.
Now, SOMEONE wakes up from a nap.
SOMEONE rubs SOMEONE's foot as she sits under the metallic blanket.
A veiny red discoloration on his left pack. As SOMEONE whispers to himself eyes closed, SOMEONE sits by him.
SOMEONE breaks off muttering and opens his eyes. SOMEONE shivers.
She flashes a meek smile. SOMEONE confers with SOMEONE.
The six inch knife in the ground is almost completely submerged.
Now, we drift over a rippling subterranean pond as the group crosses a cavern as big as a covered stadium.
SOMEONE steps out from behind a pitch black wall and shines his helmet light across a rocky passage. Water rains down lightly inside the sleek room-sized space.
SOMEONE climbs over a rock barrier carrying a yellow supply bag.
Just footsteps behind, SOMEONE follows.
SOMEONE comes next, then SOMEONE.
Bringing up the rear, SOMEONE stops and adjusts his helmet light. SOMEONE looks back at his hesitant friend who makes a fist and presses on.
Rocky partition and peers down a fairly spacious passageway, his helmet light striking the rain-like mist. He then sidles to his right and trains his light beam down a smaller tunnel.
SOMEONE marches on, saddled with gear. He stumbles.
SOMEONE continues up an incline.
They share a grin and SOMEONE leads them ahead.
SOMEONE's gaze grows mildly sullen and distant.
As SOMEONE eyes him squarely, SOMEONE deflects the order with a brotherly smirk.
He looks at more shimmering blood on his palm and makes a fist.
He closes his eyes and nods.
SOMEONE continues on wearing a bulky white rebreather on her back.
On a ledge above them, SOMEONE hauls up his gear.
SOMEONE arrives.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE go looking for him.
SOMEONE leads the way into another rocky den.
A crude carving reads "George was here".
Blood trails from SOMEONE's mouth.
Light from his partner's helmet dwindles on the dying man.
The last of the light fades out, leaving us in total darkness.
Now, SOMEONE snaps photographs of the cave walls.
SOMEONE sits on a boulder nearby.
As SOMEONE returns with his camera, SOMEONE notices him.
SOMEONE hands supplies up to his father.
SOMEONE looks on uncertainly.
His father leaves SOMEONE who sits up, wincing.
A mildly defiant grin fades from SOMEONE's face. SOMEONE rubs his neck.
A slack-jawed SOMEONE drops his hand on his lap.
He looks at SOMEONE who sadly gazes at the floor. SOMEONE squeezes SOMEONE's shoulder then leaves his side.
SOMEONE fixes the collar of his vest and hangs his head.
Now, SOMEONE marches alone through another cavern, his helmet light shines over a winding path through the uneven rock floor. SOMEONE's light shines about 50 yards up ahead.
SOMEONE appears just inside it.
The veteran caver peers through the opening into another darkened chamber. He sets down his yellow supply bag.
Catch up and set down their own gear. As SOMEONE crawls through the opening, his helmet light dims out. He holds his hand before it to verify. SOMEONE and SOMEONE rest.
Walls bears some irregularities. SOMEONE spots a ledge and opening across the cauldron.
Out of the trickling chamber, SOMEONE peers into it.
SOMEONE blows on her hands.
SOMEONE hugs SOMEONE.
Later in the cauldron chamber, SOMEONE hangs from a rope and harness. The others watch him through the oval hole.
He goes to another ledge below.
Water rains down on him. SOMEONE feeds out some slack.
To some coiled rope on his hip. The young man scans the chamber walls.
Down at the churning pool, gets a hold on the wall, and leans out far under a light waterfall.
SOMEONE gives him some more slack and SOMEONE repositions himself on the ledge.
He extends his left foot to another crag about three feet away.
He feeds him a few more inches. SOMEONE finds a secure position and studies the wall.
He keep kimself onto the ledge.
Water splashes from below.
SOMEONE looks up from the ledge below.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE on the other side.
SOMEONE shines a flashlight on her.
Now, as SOMEONE coils a handful of rope, he glances at SOMEONE who stares off with a stunned gaze, his head propped on his hand.
SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a disbelieving glance. SOMEONE sets down his ropes and looks across the way.
His son sits on a ledge, his mouth set in a line and his eyes staring blankly. SOMEONE's chest heaves.
SOMEONE glares at him.
Tears stream down SOMEONE's cheeks.
His face hardens.
SOMEONE glances away.
SOMEONE's brow furrows.
SOMEONE meets his gaze and holds it.
He sits on a ledge below Josh's, resting his hands on his knee.
He shifts his eyes.
Under his father's steady gaze, SOMEONE's chin trembles. His face contorts in anguish.
SOMEONE moves to his son's ledge and crouches. He places a hand on SOMEONE's shoulder.
He rubs his cheek.
Pulling SOMEONE close, he hugs him.
Squeezes his eyes shut.
SOMEONE glares at the father and son.
Shifting his jaw, SOMEONE pulls away.
He meets his father's gaze and nods.
SOMEONE stumbles as he makes his way over the uneven ground.
Trudging past stalagmites, he and SOMEONE find an underwater cave on the opposite side of the chamber. At the water's edge, SOMEONE bends at the waist, resting his hands on his legs.
As they stare at the dark water, SOMEONE joins them.
He scans the submerged cave, then takes off his bag and lets it fall to the ground.
He dives into the water.
As SOMEONE swims around a corner in a narrow passageway, SOMEONE catches up and grabs on to his leg.
But finds the cave ceiling above, holding him underwater.
His hands feeling for a break in the rock.
SOMEONE eyes the water surface.
Path of light pierces the darkness at the cave's entrance and he swims toward it.
His own headlamp off his helmet and replaces it with his son's.
SOMEONE shifts his somber eyes.
SOMEONE stares off.
SOMEONE's lips spread into a smile and he nods.
He gives a wide grin.
SOMEONE looks away.
Pushing out his jaw, he gives a thoughtful look, then abruptly shifts his gaze to a section of the cave's wall near SOMEONE. He stands, sniffing the air.
SOMEONE watches his son head to an eye-level cavity in the rock.Reaching inside, SOMEONE touches a dark, muddy substance, then lifts his fingers to his nose.
Smiling, he turns to his father and smears some of the sludge on his cheek. SOMEONE looks up.
He joins SOMEONE by the cavity.
Self into the hole.
Later, he and SOMEONE climb a narrow gap between two rock faces, pressing their backs to one and gripping the other with their hands and feet.
Lifting his foot, SOMEONE finds a hold.
SOMEONE grabs a piece of jutting rock.
SOMEONE straightens, pushing himself higher.
SOMEONE rests his back on the rock.
He leans against his arm.
Drops of water splash against their helmets, SOMEONE turns to his father and meets his gaze with a broad grin.
He blinks against the falling water, his chest heaving. As his son's light glows on his face, SOMEONE looks away and swallows.
He resumes climbing.
The climbers' lights as they ascend the narrow chimney.
His body to bridge the gap.
With a hand gripping each rock face, SOMEONE steps on to his father's thigh,
body, and grabs a ledge. SOMEONE grits his teeth as SOMEONE's weight bears down on him.
SOMEONE pulls himself onto the ledge.
The light on SOMEONE's helmet torch fades out.
He checks for his light's reflection on his palm.
SOMEONE lifts his hand to the light on his own helmet and switches it off.
Darkness envelopes the climbers.
Now, SOMEONE's helmet light emerges from darkness, illuminating the walls of a tunnel as he crawls through it.
Follows without a light, his figure disappearing in the blackness behind his father.
Ahead, the walls of the tunnel widen and the ceiling rises slightly.
As SOMEONE moves forward, his light fades out.
He turns on his wristwatch's light and it glows on his determined face. Holding its button down, he creeps forward, no longer crawling but crouched under the low ceiling.
He stumbles, then winces and stops walking.
SOMEONE pauses beside him and SOMEONE shoots him a glance.
He lowers himself to the ground and leans against the tunnel's wall, then releases the button for his watch light.
As SOMEONE lifts his hand, a trace of light reflects on his palm and fingers.
He shifts his gaze to SOMEONE.
SOMEONE looks at his son, his profile traced in a glimmer of light. The climber stare down the tunnel where more light gleams of its jagged walls.
Daylight bathes their faces as they emerge from a fissure and step into a cavern.
At its center, a brilliant shaft of sunlight glows down through a hole in its high ceiling.
As they walk toward it, SOMEONE removes his helmet.
SOMEONE removes his helmet as well and his father lifts his face to the hole. Insects flutter around the blazing sunbeam.
Above ground, vegetation lines the hole's perimeter.
SOMEONE lowers his gaze from the natural skylight and notices a weathered military vehicle sitting below it.
SOMEONE climbs on to the tank.
He peers down its hatch, then straightens.
Rain falls on SOMEONE's face as he looks up.
Leaps off the tank, landing in soft, muddy ground. Together, he and SOMEONE crouch and examine some skeletal remains.
Later, a view through the skylight shows towering trees below a cloudy sky. Pale light glimmers on raindrop
as they fall into the cavern. Squatting, SOMEONE fills a container with oil from the tank, then looks over at SOMEONE who strikes a flint under the shelter of a wheel well. He lights a makeshift torch then grins.
As SOMEONE rises with his flaming cylindrical container in hand, SOMEONE shoves fabric into the top of his own oil-filled container.
SOMEONE lights his father's torch with his own and they lift them as if toasting.
With a thoughtful frown, SOMEONE glances at his father.
Now, a wide view shows pale light shining through the hole casting the cavern in a purple-tinged glow.
Holding his makeshift torch, SOMEONE glances around and follows his son into a tunnel. As the light from his flame disappears, our view glides to writing etched in the side of the tank, "Frank and SOMEONE were here. See ya."
Later, orange light from SOMEONE's torch flickers on the rock walls as he leads his father through the tunnel. It widens and he climbs down a ledge, his eyes squinting into a dim chamber.
Smiling, he crouches beside a body of water.
Slipping, SOMEONE slides down the ledge on his rear.
SOMEONE looks over.
SOMEONE rises and SOMEONE shifts his helmet as his son follows the river.
Now with their torches held out, the climbers take careful steps shuffling across muddy ground.
Looking down, SOMEONE pauses and furrows his brow. He crouches to examine some abandoned gear.
He glances at SOMEONE who drops his supply bag and crouches by the equipment as well. Setting down his torch, he checks a gauge.
He test a dive light.
Now, SOMEONE's feet splash in shallow water as they hike into another chamber.
Their light shine on SOMEONE.
Smeared in dirt, SOMEONE grins as he crawls over to them. SOMEONE glares down at him.
SOMEONE rolls his eyes.
He gives SOMEONE a frenzied look.
SOMEONE sets down his bag and SOMEONE rummages through it, finding a bag of food.
Turning away from SOMEONE, SOMEONE moves through the chamber, his eyes scanning the ground.
SOMEONE's light falls on SOMEONE's body, her eyes staring lifelessly.
SOMEONE's expression crumbles and SOMEONE turns to see SOMEONE's pale and swollen face.
Dribbles a handful of dried food into his mouth.
Gaze at SOMEONE's discarded rebreather pack, SOMEONE finds three light sticks inside.
As SOMEONE shoves more food into his mouth, SOMEONE rises.
SOMEONE watches them leave.
SOMEONE's eyes widen and his grip goes slack.
Man panting beside him.
Shaking his head, SOMEONE returns to his back, his hand pressed to his son's cheek.
SOMEONE pats SOMEONE's hand.
Young man turns to see SOMEONE rising to his feet nearby holding a glow stick.
SOMEONE glares. SOMEONE averts his gaze, giving a dumbfounded shake of his head. As SOMEONE trembles
on the ground struggling to breath, SOMEONE watches, heaving a sigh. Tears well in his eyes.
As SOMEONE steps away, SOMEONE's glare follows him.
SOMEONE shrugs with resignation, shaking his head at the cave walls. He dives into the pool and disappears.
SOMEONE stares after him.
His father's side, SOMEONE drops to his knees and cradles his head in his hand.
SOMEONE grimaces.
SOMEONE lowers him into the pool.
Gently supports SOMEONE's head.
SOMEONE lies flat, buoyed by the water.
Sobbing, SOMEONE shakes his head.
As SOMEONE's hand grips his son's arm, SOMEONE's lips tremble.
Meanwhile in the underwater cave, SOMEONE, illuminated by the green light of the glow stick feels his way along the rocks above with clenched teeth.
Emerging in open water, he does a breaststroke toward the murky
Back in the cave, the oil candle's flame slowly extinguishes, leaving the area in darkness.
Break in half, bathing everything in a green glow. He sets the stick aside as his father shivers in the water.
Nods slowly. SOMEONE's pursed lips form a brief, loving smile.
He sets his jaw.
SOMEONE lays his forearm below SOMEONE's chin and gently applies pressure.
Underwater, a flurry of bubbles rises. SOMEONE struggles to hold back sobs.
Now in slow motion, submerged under gently lapping ripples, SOMEONE's grip loosens on his son.
SOMEONE looks down at him, lips parted.
He withdraws his hand from his father's, letting it fall back into the murk.
SOMEONE's right hand half-rises from the cloudy water. Sliding his hand from his father's forehead, SOMEONE lifts his body to the surface.
Under the green illumination of the glow stick, the young man blinks, gazing sadly.
With one hand pressed to his father's chest, SOMEONE bends down and plants a tender kiss on his forehead.
He rises, drawing his arms back and allows his father's body to float away.
Now underwater, SOMEONE emerges from a cavern, clutching a glow stick and the air cylinder.
Rise from the valve as he raises it to his lips and takes a hit.
SOMEONE inhales once again from the tank.
Coming out from around a bulging rock, he sees SOMEONE's body wedged against the ceiling up ahead.
SOMEONE crawls over jagged rocks beneath SOMEONE's lifeless, dangling arms.
Now, SOMEONE arrives at a narrow crevasse.
He takes another hit from the tank, then continues on.
Further on, SOMEONE stares resolutely forward as he feels his way along the jagged.
Glow stick dies out.
Now, SOMEONE clutches the boar tooth torch which emits a soft, warm glow.
Kicking his flippers, he continues on along a rocky passage.
As SOMEONE squeezes through a small opening, he raises the canister valve.
Narrow as he furiously twist the nozzle, then discards the tank.
With his cheeks puffed out, he edges his way up along a jutting wall of rock.
These bubbles emerge from small craters. SOMEONE crawls over and presses his lips to one.
From above, SOMEONE's face breaks the water's surface.
Inhales deeply from another air bubble.
A distant bluish light expands and shines across the big shape of SOMEONE's body.
Wincing, he re-submerges with a shake of his head.
As his near-motionless body rotates underwater, the young man shuts his eyes.
He begins to sink downward.
His body wavers.
Now, SOMEONE appears wearing his helmet light.
He smiles.
A view from underwater reveals shafts of light breaking on the pool's surface, cutting through the murk from a crevasse above.
Now, in a club, two women in old-fashioned costumes perform a traditional dance with fans in front of a DJ.
Amid dancing guests, Sebastian and SOMEONE chat with their boss and a grey-haired man.
Outside, a young woman in a bulky knit cap with a pompom on top makes a call on her cellphone.
She wears her hair loose around her round, soft features.
She looks up at the club with a furrowed brow.
The young woman heaves a grim sigh.
Her eyes fixed on the club, she lowers the phone sadly.
Now, traffic speeds along an overpass beneath the dark nighttime sky.
In the far right lane,
the casually dressed young woman rides a bicycle.
Her feet work the pedals in a steady rhythm,
her tasseled scarf billowing behind her.
At a turn, she narrowly avoids a bus and a taxi.
Her front wheel weaves unsteadily along the pavement.
As cars whisk past at high speed, she reaches a busy street.
As we ride with her, the vehicles blur and distort.
Flashing headlights fill our view.
Now, we gaze out over the city.
In a dark bedroom, a cellphone lights up on a night stand.
In bed, SOMEONE nestles close to Sebastian.
She stirs, wakes, and picks up the cellphone.
The young woman glances at her sleeping partner as she answers.
SOMEONE gets up.
Subtitles. Miss SOMEONE is on her bike and was hit by a taxi.
SOMEONE anxiously ends the call. Daytime.
We gaze past the Oriental Pearl Tower and the adjacent Huangpu River to the hazy city.
Traffic moves smoothly along the streets. At Hongking Hospital, SOMEONE bumps into a nurse.
Reaching a hall, she peers down one end.
Looking the other way, she breaks into a jog and joins a tall woman.
The woman faces a window to a room.
Following her gaze, SOMEONE finds an unconscious SOMEONE covered in casts and bandages.
SOMEONE enters the room and leans over the injured woman.
She reaches down to touch her but her hand hovers inches away.
SOMEONE straightens and shifts on her feet.
She brings the back of her hand to her mouth and squeezes her eyes shut.
Swaying unsteadily, she turns away.
SOMEONE leans against the bed rail in a grief-stricken slouch.
Later, she sits by a window.
She stares vacantly.
In a sunlit living room, SOMEONE and SOMEONE dance around as teenagers. Words appear.
1997, Shanghai.
Clad in matching red and white tracksuits, they snack on buns out of a brown paper bag.
An elegant older woman marches in.
She takes the bag and holds it up.
SOMEONE timidly avoids her gaze.
She takes SOMEONE's hand. The girl yanks it free.
The stepmother faces SOMEONE's friend.
She marches out.
SOMEONE starts to follow, but SOMEONE discreetly steps in her path.
SOMEONE slips past her, gazing after the older woman.
Facing SOMEONE, she sticks out her tongue.
Her friends nods and gives her an encouraging push.
Now, SOMEONE's stepmother plays a record.
Leaving the turntable, she starts to cross the tastefully decorated room.
She pauses and faces her guest.
Leaning against a far wall,
SOMEONE reluctantly shuffles over to the older woman.
As she gets closer, she stares at the floor.
The stepmother moves in close.
A smart girl like you with a bright future shouldn't have to spend all your time with her.
The stepmother leans in intimidatingly, a SOMEONE smile plastered on her exquisitely made up features.
As she speaks, SOMEONE stares at her stained teeth and painted lips.
Now, we peer out a window.
SOMEONE's eyes rise into view and she peeks inside.
She scans the area carefully.
She slips a note in between the pane and the sill, and gently pounds the window frame.
With a faint mischievous smirk, she sinks out of view.
Now huddled by the window, SOMEONE opens the note.
The SOMEONE characters translate to "Come and meet my family for dinner".
SOMEONE beams softly, folds the note shut, and gazes out the window with a hopeful smile.
Now, the two friends walk down a narrow alley.
Holding SOMEONE's hand, SOMEONE leads her through a doorway and across a small courtyard.
Now, at a humble kitchen table.
SOMEONE's father smiles with the girls.
Her mother brings a small pot and lifts the lid. SOMEONE inhales the steam.
SOMEONE serves her friend a dumpling.
Now, a long reed with a heavy bud at the end taps on SOMEONE's window.

A pretty, young woman opens the window and the girl ducks down.
Sitting close to her aunt, SOMEONE notices an antique slipper the size of a small child's foot.

She passes the contract to SOMEONE, who adds her signature.
In the present day, SOMEONE sits by SOMEONE's hospital bed, thoughtfully reading through some papers as sunlight pours in through the windows.
A woman in a white coat arrives.
SOMEONE's bag is at reception.
SOMEONE smiles politely and the hospital staffer goes.
The young professional flips through a few more papers, then flips their binder shut.
Now, SOMEONE's hand gingerly pulls open a large black leather satchel and finds the items within encased in clear plastic bags.
she finds a stack of orange and white note cards.
SOMEONE sets it aside with a puzzled frown.
Digging deeper in the satchel, she pulls out a dark gray garment.
She takes part of it from its plastic encasement.
It looks like a man's suit jacket.
SOMEONE's brow furrows and she continues sorting through her friend's belongings.
Next, she pulls out a manuscript.
She takes it from its bag and holds it up with a frown.
The cover page reads simply "Untitled by SOMEONE Liao".
SOMEONE flips through the pages and reads silently.
This is the story of SOMEONE and SOMEONE,
two girls born in the same month, on the same day.
Their feet bound on the same day.
Now, SOMEONE drives.
SOMEONE comes to a stop.
She notices a little girl in a blue tunic sitting nearby.
She wears her bangs short, the rest of her hair in a long braid.
She faces SOMEONE, her bare feet resting on a stool.
Hands wrap a black swath of fabric over the girl's toes and pulls hard.
Another adult firmly holds the tearful recoiling girl's shoulder as the person continues binding her feet.
The girl looks to the woman holding her shoulder.
In another home, a woman squeezes a little girl's toes together as she tightly wraps a bandage around the child's foot.
The girl bites her lip, her eyes filling with tears, and shoots a pleading glance at a stern-faced woman watching them.
The stern-faced woman stares down at the seated girl.
The child blinks and the woman lifts her to her feet.
With her lips parted in pain,
the little girl faces a pair of doors. She takes a step, then hunches over.
Hobbling forward, the little girl tries to run outside.
A lady servant stops her.
SOMEONE takes small steps.
Only through pain SOMEONE you find beauty.
Only through suffering SOMEONE you find peace.
With SOMEONE and her mother.
She extends her hand.
SOMEONE takes a few small slow steps.
Her mother grabs her hand and pulls her forward.
SOMEONE pushes on.
As the little girl turns and hobbles in the other direction,
her mother gives a gentle push.
Crisscrossed bandages around SOMEONE's ankles hold her bindings tight.
Now, in bed, SOMEONE thrashes under her covers.
Meanwhile, at her home, SOMEONE whimpers as she lies under a blanket on the floor.
Turning onto her other side, she faces a sleeping sibling.
One of SOMEONE's bound feet gets out below her blanket, its bandage is stained with blood.
A crowd watches as porters carry a sedan chair into their neighborhood.
SOMEONE's mother and father wait just outside their home.
SOMEONE stands in the doorway with a servant.
A plump woman dressed in a colorful SOMEONE robe pushes aside the curtain on the enclosed litter and steps out.
Later, she examines SOMEONE's tiny, stunted foot inside her lotus shoe.
She leans on her cane and eyes SOMEONE.
SOMEONE blinks her solemn eyes at the matchmaker.
The plump woman nods, then turns to the door.
A servant places the privileged girl in a seat beside her new laotong.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE both stare straight ahead for a long moment, then, in unison, shift their curious eyes toward each other.
Now, they write at a table.
SOMEONE gazes across the table at SOMEONE's paper.
Later, as the girls lie in bed together, SOMEONE traces characters on SOMEONE's bare back.
Now, side by side at a water basin, they wipe their faces with wash cloths.
The water reflects their images. SOMEONE with buns on either side of her head,
SOMEONE with her simple braid.
Snowflakes drift down and the girls try to catch them.
Now, they kneel at a shrine.
The Temple of Gupo Fair is a holy place. We are here today in front of Gupo to write your laotong contract and make your vows of eternal commitment.
She opens a fan with writing on it. The girls read.
The matchmaker closes the fan.
Now, the girls write side by side, their eyes intent on their careful brush strokes.
they set their papers in a fire.
The matchmaker bows.
In the present, SOMEONE sits at SOMEONE's bedside, gazing at her unconscious friend.
A bedside lamp shines its harsh light on SOMEONE's bruised face.
SOMEONE shifts her woeful eyes to her own lap and tilts her head thoughtfully.
Her gaze drifts to SOMEONE's hand which rests over.
Sliding her own hand on top of her laotong's, SOMEONE gives it a gentle squeeze.
She clutches SOMEONE's limp hand between both of hers,
then rests her cheek against them and closes her eyes.
Now, at a restaurant.
SOMEONE sits across a table from her parents.
Her mother pauses as she eats, frowning at her daughter's sullen downcast gaze.
She gives her parents a determined look.
SOMEONE sits at her car, staring off absently.
She takes out her phone and dials.
She lifts it to her ear and waits.
She hangs up.
Now, at her apartment, a pile of pages from SOMEONE's manuscript rests on a couch.
SOMEONE sits beside it. The remaining pages settled on her crossed leg.
With her elbow on the arm of the couch, she props her cheek on her hand as she reads.
In the story, SOMEONE, now a young woman, brushes characters onto a panel of a paper fan.

She tries to stifle a chuckle.
SOMEONE shoves her friend, then allows a smile.
Now, in the daytime, a procession of women with their faces hidden behind red scarves exit SOMEONE's home through a doorway adorned on each side with a red banner.
Behind them, SOMEONE holds SOMEONE's arm and guides her outside.
A red scarf hangs over SOMEONE's bridal crown,
veiling her face.
With SOMEONE at her side, the bride takes cautious steps over the threshold, then stops in front of her parents.
She eyes her daughter through the red veil.
She bows her head. SOMEONE starts to guide the bride away, but SOMEONE stops.
SOMEONE tugs on her arm,
but her laotong remains in place.
SOMEONE turns back to her parents.
With SOMEONE tugging her arm, SOMEONE reluctantly moves on, but her face remains turned toward her cheerful mother.
The two friends walk past townsfolk gathered to watch the procession, then stop at a gateway in a brick wall that encloses the property.
Standing there, Madame SOMEONE gives SOMEONE an expectant look.
The young bride turns to her laotong, the beaded fringe on her veil swaying back and forth.
Reaching into the loose sleeve of her robe, SOMEONE withdraws a folded paper fan and holds it out to her friend.
SOMEONE takes it, then lifts her gaze to her laotong's.
SOMEONE helps her slide the fan down her own sleeve.
She rests her hand on the bride's.
SOMEONE pushes aside her veil's fringe.
Her friend grabs her wrist and lowers her hand from the veil.
Swallowing, SOMEONE gives her laotong a sad look.
Still clutching the bride's hands, she glances into the street,
where musicians play by a waiting sedan chair.
Smoke billows into the air as firecrackers pop.
Now, SOMEONE sits at the edge of a curtained state bed, her hands folded in her lap.
A young man walks over and lifts off her veil, revealing her elaborate bridal crown.
A mountain of fruit rests on top, and a second veil of dangling beads offers a semi-obscured view of her nervous face.
As the groom sits beside his new bride, she scoots a few inches away from him.
He lowers his disappointed gaze, then shoots her a tentative glance.
He gently grabs the skirt of her robe
closed together tightly.
SOMEONE blinks behind the beaded fringe of her bridal crown as her husband kneels and lifts her tiny foot.
He lowers his face to her red lotus shoe.
Closing his eyes, he gently kisses and caresses her foot.
SOMEONE tries to pull it away, but he holds tight.
He kisses her instep again.
SOMEONE withdraws and he glances up at her.
Sitting up next to his bride again, he tosses his braid over his shoulder and grabs her hand.
SOMEONE tries to pull it away but he holds firm.
Avoiding his gaze, she stops struggling and blinks resignedly.
One year later. An elderly couple sits on either side of a table facing us. The man lights a pipe.
Standing in a hallway, a pregnant SOMEONE eavesdrops on the conversation.
She exits the room and sees SOMEONE.
She exits past her shy daughter-in-law.
Later, SOMEONE folds a robe in her bedroom while her husband pours tea at a small table.
SOMEONE shifts her concerned gaze away.
With his eyes averted from his wife, he takes a sip of tea.
He rests the cup just below his lips as he swallows, then turns to SOMEONE with a furrowed brow and finds her gazing at him.
She lowers her solemn eyes.
Now in the present. SOMEONE shifts her handbag's shoulder strap as she climbs some steps leading to a set of glass doors.
IPushing one open, she enters an art gallery. n the foyer, a well-dressed man sits at a table covered in artwork.
He chats with another man.
With a nod, she heads back to an exhibit room where she finds a gallery worker hanging black and white images of disfigured feet on a crisp white wall.
Walking deeper into the room, SOMEONE eyes a display podium holding pairs of tiny lotus shoes.
On another wall, a drawing of a fan sits below writing in images detailing Chinese tradition.
SOMEONE examines real paper fans sitting atop a row of display podiums.
She gazes at the writing on the spread panels of one.
A short-haired woman dressed in all black
with a straight line of bangs over her eyebrows approaches.
SOMEONE notices a projection on a wall.
Moving closer to the bright panel, she sees rows of Chinese characters.
As a gallery worker scrolls through text on a laptop,
the projected image moves as well.
This is a new interactive nu shu program.
As Claire scrolls downs the rows of characters on a second laptop,
SOMEONE gazes at the projection.
The light casts a pale glow on her delicate face.
Now, SOMEONE opens a jewelry box drawer and takes out a paper fan.
Later, she sits at a table and writes on it.
A baby rests beside her in a bassinet.
Spreading open the fan, SOMEONE reads her friend's message.

As SOMEONE returns to the gate,
a woman approaches SOMEONE.
SOMEONE joyfully clasps her hands around her friend's.

Later, they sit on a bench.
Her head hung low, SOMEONE nods morosely.
SOMEONE glances at her troubled friend, then takes her hands and shifts her gaze straight ahead.
SOMEONE lifts her eyes to her laotong's calm face and twitches a tender smile.
Now, a door closes SOMEONE into a room.

SOMEONE's aunt sits beside her on a bench in the hallway.
She lets out a breath.
SOMEONE glances at her ashamedly.
She watches sympathetically as SOMEONE hangs her head.
SOMEONE lowers her gaze and stares at the floor, lost in thought.

Now, SOMEONE sits alone at a table.
She dips a brush in ink, then begins to write on a fan spread open before her.
In another room, an old man lies on his side, smoking a long-stemmed pipe.
SOMEONE spies on him from a cracked open door.
Our view drifts from the old man's pinched, intoxicated face to the pipe in his hand and a burning opium lamp nearby.
SOMEONE shuts the door.
The image dissolves to SOMEONE as she opens the fan to the many columns of Chinese lettering in its folds.
SOMEONE gazes thoughtfully at the message,
then shuts the fan and touches it to her chin.
She dreamily closes her eyes.
As she gently presses the fan to her cheek, the image fades to black.
Now, two years later.
Our view drifts from an open burning stove to SOMEONE,
who stares off thoughtfully with an infant strapped to her back.

SOMEONE's hand reaches down and massages one foot.
She lifts it up across her knee
and gently caresses the backs of her toes.
Her soft downturned gaze remains fixed on the moment of self-care.
Her gaze growing distant.
In the butcher's house, her 19th century counterpart sleeps curled up in the humble bed.
She stirs awake and looks around.
The noblewoman sits up, her long hair loose around her shoulder.
She peers down toward the lower floor, then shifts her puzzled gaze and gets up.
Smoke, wind, and sunlight stream in from a round hole in the wall serving as a window. SOMEONE approaches it, raising a hand over her nose and mouth as she peers out.

Daylight from the windows accentuates her pale complexion as she slumbers.
A few stray wisps of her black hair obscure her delicate face,
which rests on her own outstretched arm.
Her jackets hangs slung over her chair's backrest
and her right hand clutches a few more pages.

Three sworn sisters in Jintian have promised to love me as I am.
You need not worry about me anymore.
Now, steam rises from bowls of food on a table.
SOMEONE steps into view, her head jutting forward and her arms at her sides.
She pauses by a window and gazed outward.
Clutching the fan in one hand, she raises it to her waist and rests it on her other palm.
She stares off with a dazed, stricken expression.
Silhouetted against a window, she swallows hard,
then slowly doubles over and grasps a chair at the head of the table.
She sinks down, turning her back to us as she rests her head against her hand.
The fan drops from her grasp.

then a low unmade bed tucked in a corner.
Later, she sits at a desk littered with several stacks of books, manuscripts, and documents.
SOMEONE flips through the pages of a small spiral bound notebook.
We drift closer to her and find her lips slightly pursed as she reads.
In the notebook, a pen and ink sketch depicts a delicate tree amidst a desolate landscape.
On the opposite page, an illustration shows light from an oncoming train shining brightly from a round tunnel.
SOMEONE turns to the next page
and finds it filled with writing.
Near the back cover, she discovers a folded letter addressed to her.
We see SOMEONE sitting in a red tinted bathtub. she sinks down slowly under the water.

Standing, she puts it on.
She wraps it tightly around her slender torso and hugs it close over her chest.
Her head droops forward and her eyes close as she strolls over to a sunny window.
She sways dreamily on her feet, then lifts her head and slips her hands into the pockets with a heavy sigh.
Looking down, she pulls out a small brass key with a circular toggle
and a small, round plastic coil.
SOMEONE frowns quizzically as she turns it in her fingertips.

The worker stops spreading towels over loungers and leaves.
SOMEONE gives a tiny bow and the man returns the gesture.
She waits as he heads off.
She makes her way to a bank of wooden lockers and skims her gaze over their numbers.
she slides the key into its lock and pulls open the door.
she finds a modest shrine in memory of SOMEONE's father.
A rectangular wooden plaque stands upright
bearing the man's photo and a panel of Chinese writing.
A few blue silk roses and pieces of citrus surround it.
SOMEONE lifts a folded fan of the locker's shelf.
She opens it, spreading its creased paper panels and finds writing on each one.
Flipping it over, she sees writing on only half of the back panels.
She blinks her sad eyes and closes the fan.
Her gaze falls on something else in the locker and she tilts her head for a better look.
On the bottom shelf, she finds a stack of typed pages.
Taking them out, she reads the cover page "SnowFlower And The Secret Fan."
SOMEONE flips to the next page and reads,
her intent eyes fixed on her friend's completed manuscript.
The end of this story is about things of the heart that SOMEONE never change.

casting a warm glow on SOMEONE's face.
She gazes at SOMEONE, who lies peacefully by with her eyes closed and her hands folded on her stomach.
Now, SOMEONE leans over her sister,
letting her face hover just inches from SOMEONE's.
She extends her trembling fingers and rests them upon her laotong's cheek.
Now, tears shine in SOMEONE's eyes as she stares off with a distant expression.
When SOMEONE returned home after SOMEONE's funeral,
she looked at the fan and could not allow things to end as they had,
so she opened a new panel,
dipped her brush, and wrote a final inscription.
As a tear runs down SOMEONE's cheek,
she calmly works a bamboo stylus on a panel of the open fan,
leaving several characters in black ink.
In the present, SOMEONE reads the manuscript page with doleful eyes.
Still clutching the folded fan,
she lowers the sheet of paper and stares off.
An aerial view focuses on gleaming traffic and crowded highway lanes.
The world is always changing.
Every day it's changing.
Everything in life is changing.
We have to look inside ourselves to find what stays the same.

It crawls to the back,
A green gemstone studs its back.
Now, SOMEONE hurries downstairs into a basement. He kneels in front of the brick supporting the stairs and waves his hands. A red veneer crumbles away, revealing ancient darker bricks beneath.
SOMEONE studies his dragon ring, turning it to catch the light. With each movement, boxes on a high shelf quake. SOMEONE jerks his hand to one side and the boxes tumble off the shelf. As he makes a light knocking motion, a wall buckles.

She looks away. With a nod, SOMEONE turns to head off, then turns back and furrows his brow. The woman's blue eyes briefly meet his gaze.
She nods.
She blinks confusedly.
Now in a posh apartment, the SOMEONE Dynasty urn stands by a hall doorway. As a gray-haired man passes, the urn quivers. The man returns and stares at it. The urn's side depicts the fighting sorcerers. Meanwhile,

Later, Atlantic City's hotel casinos gleam in the night air. SOMEONE<Milo> works his jaw driving his blue convertible past them.
She offers him a wad of cash.
She studies him skeptically.
She smells the cash.
SOMEONE<Milo> pouts then licks his lips.
Later, he unlocks her handcuffs and lets her out of the car.
Now, from his MINI Cooper, SOMEONE<Stewart> sees SOMEONE's<Milo's> car arrive at the Taj Mahal Casino.
With SOMEONE<Ray>.
SOMEONE<Ray> checks his phone.
He hits a button
In the casino.
Now, SOMEONE<Stewart> drives into the Taj Mahal parking lot.
Out of his car, he creeps up alongside SOMEONE's<Milo's> Delta '88.
He knocks on the trunk.
He presses an ear to the trunk and listens.
He opens the driver side door and pops the trunk.
He finds it empty.
SOMEONE<Ray> looks on.
He points at the car.
SOMEONE<Ray> slams SOMEONE's<Stewart's> head against the trunk. SOMEONE<Stewart> crumbles. Now, at a craps table,
he shows her the dice.
SOMEONE<Nicole> frowns. SOMEONE<Milo> quirks his brow at her.
She reluctantly purses her lips and blows on the dice.
He rolls a seven.
A croupier's hand nudges a tall stack of chips toward SOMEONE<Milo>. Later, SOMEONE<Nicole> blows on the dice again.

The bounty hunter rolls a seven.
SOMEONE<Nicole> fans herself nervously.
The croupier awards SOMEONE<Milo> two more stacks. Now, SOMEONE<Nicole> blows on the dice repeatedly.

The stickman eyes SOMEONE<Milo>, who throws the dice.
He rolls.
Later, in a hallway.
Now, they enter a spacious and eclectic suite.
SOMEONE<Nicole> weaves past boldly upholstered furniture.
She admires the chic lamps and mod accessories.
He cuffs her to the headboard, plops down their bags, and heads out.
As he stalks out, she flings a vase after him.
Trapped by the handcuffs, she plops onto the bed. SOMEONE<Milo> struts out of the room and presses an elevator call button. He rubs his hands together then primps in a mirror.
He boards the elevator, presses a button, and snaps open the check from Teresa.
He kisses it and the elevator closes. Later, it opens revealing a disheveled SOMEONE<Milo> clutching a drink. His shirt half untucked and his collar sticking up, he staggers out and drains the glass.
Now he stumbles down the hall, leaning against a wall for support. The drunken man takes a rest then hobbles forward and bends over his door lock. He disappears inside.
In the bedroom, SOMEONE<Nicole> lies asleep. Her handcuffed arm leaning vertically against the headboard. SOMEONE<Milo> eyes her, swaying, then sets his gun on the nightstand.
Later, on his side, he turns off the light.
He flops onto his back fully dressed and in his shoes and scooches around getting comfy.
Later, SOMEONE's<Nicole's> eyes spring open.
Raising her brow, she looks around thoughtfully, then sits up and peeks over at SOMEONE<Milo>. Just past him, she spots his gun on the nightstand.
SOMEONE lies on her back then rolls toward him,
sliding the handcuff along the top rail of the headboard.
She props herself up on her hands and knees then inches closer and reaches for the gun with her free hand.
Her fingers fall short. She tips off balance but catches herself before landing on top of SOMEONE<Milo>.
SOMEONE<Nicole> braces herself on the headboard, digs her feet into the comforter, and makes her downward facing body as stiff as a board.
She carefully straddles SOMEONE<Milo>.

She musters a smile.
She playfully smacks the headboard.
She cranes her lips close to his.
He raises his gun in front of her face.
She rears back.

He leads SOMEONE<Dwight> into a grungy bathroom where SOMEONE<Stewart> sits handcuffed to a pipe.

SOMEONE<Dwight> hits him.
Now, in the suite.
SOMEONE<Nicole> finds herself alone.
A maid enters.
She peeks into the bedroom.
SOMEONE<Nicole> glances at the handcuff.
In the bathroom, SOMEONE<Milo> steps out of the shower, tucking a towel around his waist.
In the bedroom, SOMEONE<Nicole> zips up SOMEONE's<Milo's> satchel. She tugs at the handcuff then hunkers down and winds up swinging the bag.
She flings it across the room.
It misses the ottoman and lands on the floor.
In the bathroom, SOMEONE<Milo> looks up.
As he opens the door, SOMEONE<Nicole> lies down and mimes a yawn.
She sits up and looks around.
She points at the handcuff.
He unlocks her.
Massaging her wrist, SOMEONE<Nicole> strides to the bathroom. She sees SOMEONE<Milo> following her.
He glances at her low-cut top then ogles her.
She shrugs theatrically and enters the bathroom.
He steps up to the doors.
In the bathroom, SOMEONE<Nicole> takes SOMEONE's<Milo's> Taser from under her skirt.
She turns it on.
She tasers him in the neck. SOMEONE<Milo> convulses and crumples. SOMEONE<Nicole> skips over him and grabs her bag.
Later, at the elevators, she presses the call button.

SOMEONE<Nicole> hops into the shaded seat.
They ride away.
SOMEONE<Nicole> looks in her bag.
The driver checks her out.
SOMEONE<Nicole> looks off and gives a half-wince, half-smile.
Later, SOMEONE<Nicole> pedals the stolen pedicab by herself.
The teenager chases her on foot. She rides down a ramp. Now, in the hotel suite's bathroom, SOMEONE<Milo> awakens on the floor. Holding his head, he sits up.
Later, an aerial view shows his baby-blue Delta driving away from the Taj Mahal. Behind the wheel, SOMEONE<Milo> eyes the two-inch red SOMEONE<mark> on his neck in the rear-view mirror then touches it and winces.
Now, SOMEONE<Nicole> struggles to pedal down a highway. Cringing, she leans wearily over the handlebars.
SOMEONE<Milo> spots the pedicab from a block behind and gives a vengeful smile.
SOMEONE<Nicole> spots him and scowls. She pedals faster.
He drives up and taps the back of the pedicab with his bumper.
SOMEONE<Nicole> gapes.
SOMEONE<Milo> accelerates and taps her again. Several other vehicles speed past them. SOMEONE<Milo> drives up close behind her then backs off. SOMEONE<Nicole> pedals exhaustedly then halts, slumping. SOMEONE<Milo> stops inches behind her then scoots forward and bumps the pedicab again.
SOMEONE<Nicole> sneers. A sedan passes them and she climbs off the bike.
She grabs up her purse and glares at him, then stalks around to the passenger door and reaches for the handle.
SOMEONE<Milo> backs up.
He shifts into park and raises both hands innocently. SOMEONE<Nicole> glances around. She treads back to the door, her eyes locked on SOMEONE's<Milo's>.
As she reaches for the handle, the car lurches forward.
SOMEONE<Nicole> winces, stifling tears, then stares off. SOMEONE<Milo> eyes her churlishly.
Her lips tighten and she shakes her head, looking skyward.
She claps a hand to her mouth.
SOMEONE<Milo> glances away.
SOMEONE<Nicole> brushes her hair out of her face then sobs into her hand.
He shifts the car into park, gets out, and faces his ex-wife.
She stays put. Her posture wounded and childlike.
He knits his brow.
SOMEONE<Nicole> tugs on the door handle, which sticks, then gives.
She climbs into the seat and slams the door shut.
SOMEONE<Milo> looks over his shoulder and spots a billboard in a field.
It reads, Cupid's Cabin and shows a picture of a bed and breakfast in a Victorian style mansion.
The bounty hunter purses his lips.
He shuffles back alongside the car.
In the passenger seat, SOMEONE<Nicole> wipes her eyes then rests her forehead on the back of her hand, hiding her face.
SOMEONE<Milo> sheepishly opens his door and takes his seat at the wheel.
He glances at SOMEONE<Nicole>.
He backs the car away from the pedicab, steers around it, and drives off.
Now, SOMEONE<Irene> leads an elderly man with fuzzy hair into the grungy bathroom.
SOMEONE<Stewart> rests his leg on the toilet.
The man takes out a giant syringe.
The vet jabs the needle into SOMEONE's<Stewart's> neck.
Now, in SOMEONE's<Milo's> car, SOMEONE<Nicole> rides with one wrist cuffed to the door.
SOMEONE<Nicole> spots a luxury pick-up in her side mirror then eyes it over her shoulder.
SOMEONE<Milo> aims the rear-view mirror at it.
The pick-up pulls up beside them.
As the chiseled thug aims a gun at them from behind the wheel, SOMEONE<Nicole> jams her foot on the gas pedal. SOMEONE<Milo> veers onto the shoulder, then into oncoming traffic on a one-way street. The thug shoots at them from the parallel two-way road.
Drawing his gun, SOMEONE<Milo> returns fire. SOMEONE<Nicole> cowers. The pick-up swerves onto the one-way street and jams itself alongside the Delta, mangling the convertible's headlight and SOMEONE<fender>. The vehicles separate. SOMEONE<Milo> bashes the pick-up and takes aim.
As they speed forward, shoving against each other, SOMEONE<Nicole> spots an SUV headed straight for the thug's vehicle.
Swerving, the chiseled man bursts through construction barricades then ramps up a stack of barricades and launches into mid-air. The pick-up lands on its roof and skids across the two-lane road. Reaching a grassy field, it tumbles onto its side. SOMEONE<Milo> pulls over.
She wrenches her cuffed arm.
He gets out and surveys the damage.
As SOMEONE<Milo> jogs toward the luxury pick-up, the thug wriggles out through a window on the other side. Nearing he vehicle, SOMEONE<Milo> slows and aims his gun.
His assailant gets to his feet, using the pick-up as cover.
The bounty hunter ventures toward the vehicles tail-end and the thug edges around its front. SOMEONE<Milo> arrives on the other side and finds no sign of the gunman.
Turning back, he finds himself aiming at SOMEONE<Nicole>.
She clutches her door's broken-off inner panel.
On the one way street, the thug yanks a woman from her mini-van, gets in, and speeds off.
SOMEONE<Milo> gawks.
Later, they search the pick-up together.
He opens the covered bed.
He finds a golf bag.
She hurls the cup at him.
SOMEONE<Nicole> climbs out.
SOMEONE<Nicole> notices a tag.
SOMEONE<Nicole> glares then yields a smile. Now, SOMEONE's<Milo's> ragtop follows a winding road toward a mansion perched atop an immaculately landscaped hill. At the mansions entrance, they surrender the car to a valet.
Inside, a pristinely quaffed woman works a reception desk.
Her red painted lips primly stifle an excited smile.
They follow her through the lobby.
The woman frowns.
The woman scowls suspiciously.
SOMEONE<Nicole> smiles tightly and SOMEONE<Milo> shakes his head.
The couple steps out back and wanders through a festive picnic.
He walks her to the party's edge.
They find some caddies.
One rumples his lips then flees.
He scurries down some steps.
SOMEONE<Milo> gives chase.
The caddy leads him down a hill and across a grassy driving range. The bounty hunter frantically dodges golf balls as they whiz toward him. He leaps over one then ducks another. One ball buzzes low over his head and a fourth whips past his nose. As he leaves the range and runs onto a green, SOMEONE<Nicole> drives up in a golf cart.
Elsewhere, the caddy peeks out from a sunken sand trap.
The caddy crawls out from hiding.
As he holds the flag for putting golfers, SOMEONE<Milo> spies him.
SOMEONE<Nicole> steers the cart in the caddy's direction. The young man spots them and his polite smile fades.
Dropping the flag, he dashes over a hill.
Cresting the rise, the cart speeds toward a pond.
SOMEONE<Milo> leaps out, tackles the caddy, and tumbles with him into the water.
The out of control cart plunges in beside them.

SOMEONE<Nicole> looks away then faces him defenselessly.
SOMEONE<Nicole> tearfully tightens her lips.
Now, the two stroll down a hallway lit cheerily with glass-shaded lamps.
SOMEONE<Nicole> pauses to eye an inscription on one of the doors.
Reaching another door, they find a lavender heart-shaped sign that reads, Bliss in rosy cursive letters.
SOMEONE<Milo> and SOMEONE<Nicole> chuckle at the frilly placard then share a warm lingering gaze.
SOMEONE<Nicole> starts to open her mouth, then shakes her head and smiles.
Staring at her intently, he nods.
As he unlocks the door, he steps in close and leans his face toward hers.
SOMEONE<Milo> opens the door, revealing a narrow four-post bed on a lavender carpet.

SOMEONE<Milo> lights candles around the room and pops a CD into a player.
SOMEONE<Nicole> peeks out from the bathroom.
His back to SOMEONE<Nicole>, SOMEONE<Milo> hangs up.
His ex-wife returns to the bathroom unnoticed. Now, she steps out wrapped tightly in a bathrobe.
She avoids SOMEONE's<Milo's> gaze.
Marching to the bed, she blows out a candle on a bedside table, turns off the CD player, and hurls some pillows to the floor.
She throws down more pillows until only a few remain.
She blows out another candle and climbs under the covers.
Lying on her back, SOMEONE<Nicole> closes her eyes then sneakily peeks one open. She watches as SOMEONE<Milo> blows out more candles. He snuffs the last one with his hand.
He pops a candy into his mouth and climbs into bed fully clothed. He scoots up against SOMEONE<Nicole> and folds his arms.
SOMEONE<Nicole> eyes him as he chews. He glances over and she looks away.
He closes his eyes.
She climbs out of bed and grabs a blanket then swipes the pillow out from behind SOMEONE's<Milo's> head.
He bumps the headboard.
As he winces, SOMEONE<Nicole> throws the pillow at his face. She settles onto a window bench.
Closing his eyes, SOMEONE<Milo> folds his hands behind his head.
From the bench, SOMEONE<Nicole> turns and glares at him.
Later, she wears her own clothes as she slams the suite's door.
SOMEONE<Milo> stirs. He finds himself cuffed to the bed.
SOMEONE<Nicole> jingles the handcuff keys.
She leaves.
SOMEONE<Milo> yanks on his cuff secured tightly to the headboard.
As SOMEONE<Nicole> races out the door, SOMEONE<Milo> frantically yanks on the headboard. He breaks off the top and falls back onto the bed.
Now, as he rushes outside, SOMEONE<Nicole> pulls his car out of the drive.
Still attached to the headboard, he chases after her. The convertible speeds away.
He watches as it disappears around a corner.
Meanwhile, at a gas station, SOMEONE<Dwight> opens his trunk.
He plucks a SOMEONE<bill> from the garbage bag full of cash and heads toward a convenient store.
SOMEONE<Dwight> halts, gives Ray the finger, and steps into the store. Ray spots SOMEONE's<Milo's> car as it rides by.
At cupid's cabin, as SOMEONE<Milo> stands on the front stoop, SOMEONE<Edmund> shuts the door.

SOMEONE<Nicole> sits.
SOMEONE's<Nicole's> eyes widen.
Sitting beside her, SOMEONE<Boner> leans back and smiles.
With a wave, SOMEONE<Nicole> hurries through the parlor.
Brushing her hair out of her face, she peers over her shoulder then casually heads to the bathroom.
She opens the door, steps inside, and waits briefly. Glancing around, she creeps out of the bathroom and makes her way up some stairs. Now, she opens a door to a wood-paneled entry way. She cautiously checks over her shoulder then tiptoes inside.
Seen through another doorway, an office chair sits at a desk with a giant mural of a snarling tiger behind it.
A red and black bowling shirt hangs on the back of the chair.
SOMEONE<Nicole> scurries into the office.
She sifts through a stack of paperwork then sits at the desk and rifles through files and drawers.
Swiveling in the chair, she spots a framed photo of a bowling team. In it, SOMEONE<Bobby> and SOMEONE<Earl> pose with two teammates.
A caption reads, Police Bowling League.
SOMEONE<Nicole> looks around then sets the photo back on a trophy shelf.

Hidden, SOMEONE<Nicole> spots them. SOMEONE<Milo> drops his gun.
SOMEONE<Nicole> mouths, Oh God and searches the shelves around her.

In the high-ceilinged modern facility, a slender woman with short, curly hair swivels in her chair.
She raises her arms as a message flashes on her screen. Call disconnected.
The 911 operator locks her hands behind her head and leans back in her chair.

SOMEONE smiles and accepts an incoming call.
A man reaches into the broken window as SOMEONE goes to the stairs. SOMEONE rapidly types on her computer.
The intruder walks down the upstairs hall and opens one of the doors. As it swings shut behind him, the dark ominous figure stands frozen in a vestibule with an arched entry.
He goes to the archway and briefly surveys the room before kneeling at the foot of the bed.
Catching sight of his reflection in a mirror,
the prowler walks up to an open closet door.
He slowly pulls it closed as he checks behind it.
His face obscured by a ball cap, the menacing man turns. He heads toward a beaded curtain and parts it.
He returns to the vestibule and closes the door to the hall.
Pausing, he slowly goes back into the room.
From the archway, he spies a French window that stands ajar.

Her boss enters the room and she turns to face her.
SOMEONE shrugs and shakes her head.
She steps past her boss and leaves the room.

Now, patrons ride an escalator in the center of an indoor sunlit mall.
On the lower level, children ride a miniature train around a display of oversized lollipops.
Amid the shoppers, two teenage girls ride up the escalator.
Autumn pulls out a second phone.
Smiling, Autumn's blond friend shakes her head.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE dumps a prescription pill into her hand by a running bathroom faucet.
She sips water from a clear plastic cup and thrusts back her head as she swallows.

She grabs the phone and stands, looking after Autumn.
Smiling, the blond shakes her head and slides the phone into her back pocket.

Opening her eyes, the dazed teen faces the interior of a car's trunk.
Her eyes shift about.
Slowly blinking, the blond rolls her head to the side.
A soft red light glows on her cheek from one of the tail lights.
The young blond quickly glances around.
Realizing her location, she presses her hands to the roof,
then frantically bangs on the pulsating speaker.

The maroon sedan speeds beneath an overpass, moving easily with other cars in light traffic.
SOMEONE's boss approaches.
From overhead, the maroon sedan speeds along the freeway. The kidnapper reaches for the radio. He cranks the volume as SOMEONE struggles in the trunk. She pries off the tail light's back cover, then grabs a short-handled paint roller.
Now, a call comes in to SOMEONE's station.
SOMEONE enters the plate in their system.
Moving a tarp, her eyes widen.

An industrial rail yard full of motionless freight trains rests beside the large boulevard. The kidnapper drives along as SOMEONE pries open a paint can with a screw driver.
A search chopper soars overhead.

Facing forward, the kidnapper's jaw trembles. His teeth clink together as he fixates on the red stop light.
His large sunglasses rest on the center of his nose, exposing his dark, narrow eyes.
SOMEONE uncaps the other paint can and moves it to the hole.
She carefully tilts the can with both hands.
Glancing over, the suited driver watches the mysterious man as the light turns.
She desperately wipes the phone. The kidnapper screeches to a halt in an empty parking lot and marches to the trunk. He glares down at the busted tail light and patch of white paint. SOMEONE's mouth hangs open as she eyes the hole. Lowering the phone, she slips it into her back pocket. The kidnapper chuckles. The frightened teen arms herself with the screw driver.
He aims the screw driver at her eye then runs his fingers along her paint-stained hair.

At dusk, a red car passes terrain decorated with names spelled out in white stones.
At the wheel, SOMEONE glances over at SOMEONE, who sleeps with her head leaned against the window.

SOMEONE breaks into a run.
The family man races out of a cul-de-sac and reaches a narrow, rain-soaked road.

Running at a stilted, awkward gait,

SOMEONE's looking at us as he replies. His gaze wilts. He glances at the band, then rubs his face.

and shines down on a lush mountain ridge.

He exits past the portraits of his great great grandparents.
The image dissolves to a sprawling wind-blown property.
SOMEONE’s car glides toward a fork in a long driveway.
To one side lies a large ranch style house and a tennis court.
On the other, grazing ducks scatter as SOMEONE pulls over onto a well-manicured lawn and parks.
Now, he enters the large house, allowing sunlight to filter through the screen door into the unlit living room.
As he pushes open the curtains on the front windows,
more daylight washes over a wall decorated with framed photos.
He strolls past it,
then stops and gazes at the black and white images of his ancestors.
A mustached man gives a serious look. Another shows a frizzy-haired woman.
In a third photo, four men in suits stand on a building's front steps.
Behind the glass of a large frame, wooden block letters spell out "Kikila". Above an antique photo of a man with a mutton chop beard, a plaque beside it reads "Cecil Kikila King. the namesake of this beautiful place. He was a prominent attorney, banker, and socialite in old Hawaii.".
SOMEONE eyes more photos of family members throughout the years. two men and two women in 1920s era garb.
Leaving the photos, SOMEONE steps out onto the lawn.

The scene in front of him fades to SOMEONE's hospital room, where our view edges closer to the back of his head
as he watches his family.
Now, we travel up the bed quilt to SOMEONE's hands
still curled loosely around the towel rolls.
Just above the neckline of her hospital gown,
a gauze dressing covers the stoma in her trachea,
its center dampened with a moist circle.
Her mouth hangs open, her lips dry and slightly parched,
while her head lies tilted to one side.
On a couch, SOMEONE lies asleep.

Looking over her frail form, he breathes softly.
His fingers caress the pale woman's hair just above her forehead.
With a fond look in his eyes,
he smiles.
He bends down and leans over her, his fingers lingering on her brow.
He gives her a long, gentle kiss on the lips, then remains
hovering just inches above her.
A tear rolls down his nose.
In a waiting area, SOMEONE sits beside her father with tears in her eyes.
Our view drifts to SOMEONE's weary face as he stares across the room.
The door to SOMEONE's room opens.
SOMEONE steps out, her eyes puffy and red.
SOMEONE crosses the hallway toward her family.
SOMEONE rises from his chair and faces her.
SOMEONE hugs her father.
Resting her chin on his shoulder, she gazes upward.
He kisses her temple, then stands aside as she crosses to SOMEONE.
She gives her shaggy-haired friend a hug.
Peering over his shoulder with her arm wrapped around his neck.
SOMEONE faces her younger sister.
Gazing up from her chair, SOMEONE purses her lips.
SOMEONE offers her hands, then guides her sister up from her seat.
She wraps her arm around the girl and they head off together.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch SOMEONE lead SOMEONE across the hallway
SOMEONE lead SOMEONE into SOMEONE's room.
Now, a puffy cumulus cloud dominates the lower half of a sky view.
Its vapor edge forms fanciful bulges and dips across the blueness green vegetation blankets a mountain range.
On the yet unsold land, the overlook offers a majestic view of the cove and the meadows and wild groves inland of it.
Beyond a line of breaking waves, vibrant shades of ocean blue extend to the horizon meeting powder blue sky.
The blossoms of a plumeria flutter in a breeze, their petals in shades of yellow and pink.
Now, sitting aboard an outrigger canoe, SOMEONE nods and accepts a container.
She wears a pink and white lei around her neck.
SOMEONE watches his daughter from across the boat, wearing a lei of autumn colors.
They float about a mile from the urban coastline.
SOMEONE draws a scoop of ashes from the container and looks at her father.
He shifts his serene gaze, then gives her a soft nod.
The peaceful young woman looks at the ashes and purses her lips.
Sitting in the middle of the boat,
SOMEONE watches her sister pour the scoop of ashes into the water.
SOMEONE hands the container to her.
They younger girl tearfully takes hold of the scoop handle, but lets go of it and passes the canister on to SOMEONE.
The middle-aged widower gazes at the gray dust.
A skyward view from the ashes shows a breeze blowing through his grey hair.
The girls watch as he holds the container over the side of the boat
and pours the rest of SOMEONE's ashes into the sea.
He taps the container against the side of the canoe to empty it completely.
SOMEONE watches the ashes mix with the water, then glances at his daughters.
He takes off his lei and sets it on the water.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE do the same.
They watch their leis floating beside the boat, bobbing on the surface.
Seen from underwater, the leis show in silhouette against the gleaming sunlight.
They take on amoeba-like shapes as they float beside the canoe.
SOMEONE lies on the couch under a blanket.
Beyond the couch, SOMEONE steps out from an arched doorway with two bowls. In shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE and hands her one of the bowls.
SOMEONE sits on the couch and rests his feet on an ottoman.
As they eat their ice cream, SOMEONE enters the distant dining room and digs through a bag on the table.
SOMEONE adjusts the end of SOMEONE's blanket and covers his legs.
SOMEONE notices them from the dining room and strides observantly through an archway.
Arms folded, she halts behind the ice cream eating pair.
SOMEONE drops her arms to her sides, then steps around the couch and takes a seat
beside her father, forcing him more into the middle as she takes a corner of the blanket.
As they remain focused on their movie, SOMEONE helps SOMEONE lay the blanket over her legs.
He hands her his bowl of ice cream and she rests it on her lap.
As the trio watch the movie together,
Her square-jawed husband stares grimly at her over his reading glasses.
Breaking off his stare, he answers his cell.
Now, photos of his comatose wife fill a scrapbook.
At a posh house.
SOMEONE<Matt> sees SOMEONE<Scottie> hurl lawn chairs into a pool.
SOMEONE<Matt> briefly lowers the phone and glowers at it.
Now, in windy, overcast weather, a silver sedan drives through a middle class neighborhood.
As it passes, we glimpse SOMEONE<Scottie> riding shotgun.
The car arrives at a house. Now a round-faced woman with long, black hair opens its door.
SOMEONE<Matt> follows SOMEONE<Scottie> in.
The mother leads them into a sprawling cluttered living room where a chubby pre-teen girl watches TV.
Sharing her mother's round face and sullen pout, she faces her visitors. Her mother looks to them indignantly, hands on her hips.
SOMEONE<Matt> glances at SOMEONE's<Lani's> angry mother.
His daughter nods.
She nods emphatically.
SOMEONE<Matt> gives a shrug of the hand.
The mother faces her daughter inquiringly.
SOMEONE<Lani> nods. Now the woman follows the visitors out to her porch.
She nods plainly. SOMEONE<Matt> wears a nonplussed smile, then walks his daughter to their car.
In a home office.
Later, he searches stacks of documents.
SOMEONE<Matt> views two portraits on a wall. One shows a Polynesian woman, the other a bearded Caucasian man.
SOMEONE<Matt> rubs his eyes. Now, he works in a metropolitan office.
A secretary looks in.
SOMEONE<Matt> covers a half-eaten salad. In a meeting room, he greets seven people in Hawaiian shirts.
As his cousins debate, SOMEONE<Matt> sits at the head of the conference table, his chin perched thoughtfully on his hand.
His gaze grows distant and his hand droops.
Later, he enters the hospital through sliding glass doors.
We peer down a square spiral stairwell.
SOMEONE<Matt> climbs flight after flight.
A balding doctor faces SOMEONE<Matt>.
Hunched forward, SOMEONE<Matt> drops his hollow gaze.
His eyes glisten and he hangs his head.
SOMEONE<Matt> nods faintly, then screws his jaw to one side.
SOMEONE<Matt> leans back in his seat.
The doctor unhappily faces him.
At the end of a hallway, a door's window frames a view of SOMEONE<Matt> shambling closer, his arms hanging at his sides.
He pulls the door open and passes through with a thunderstruck expression on his face.
His gait is listless and steady as he makes his way past a few recovery rooms.
He passes behind a staffer on the phone at a nurse's station.
A distant doorway shows a nurse making a bed.
SOMEONE's<Matt's> expression grows woeful as he nears the far end of the ward.
He halts at a door to a private room and takes it in.
Entering, SOMEONE<Matt> finds an attractive dark-haired woman putting makeup on his gaunt wife.
A fit, pleasant-faced man sits nearby.
SOMEONE<Matt> mocks an optimistic smile, then looks pointedly in SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> direction.
Later, his car travels past a park.
SOMEONE<Scottie> rides shotgun as he makes a right turn into a parking lot.
They pass a sign that reads "Ocean Outrigger Club".
Now in a baggy T-shirt and shorts, SOMEONE<Matt> sits on the sunny beach, gazing at the surf.
SOMEONE<Scottie> plays in shallow water near the shore.
Wearing a yellow swim mask, she undulates face down in the water.
Her long, brown hair clings like seaweed at her shoulders as she pops up for air.
SOMEONE<Matt> squints in the sunlight as he watches.
He looks away briefly.
As SOMEONE<Scottie> does a handstand, her legs wobble at unsteady angles.
Now in a club restaurant, SOMEONE<Matt> watches her fondly.
As she eats an ice cream sundae, SOMEONE wipes ice cream from her mouth with a napkin.
SOMEONE<Matt> looks down and gives a noncommittal shrug.
Lifting his gaze, he notices someone in the distance.
His expression darkens.
Behind his daughter, a muscular, blond man arrives at the bar with some friends.
He notices SOMEONE<Matt>.
He approaches the table.
Troy shifts his wounded gaze.
Eating her sundae, SOMEONE<Scottie> squints up at Troy.
He glances at her, starts to go, but hesitates.
SOMEONE<Scottie> runs out. SOMEONE<Matt> glares at Troy.
He hurries after his daughter.
SOMEONE<Matt> leads his daughter back.
They pass the bar where Troy drinks beer with his friends.
The child flips him the bird.
Troy responds with a resigned nod. Now a plane soars into the sky. On a map, a dotted line traces a path from Oahu to the island of Hawaii.
On the plane, SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Scottie> peer through a window at a verdant coastline.
At dusk, a red car passes terrain decorated with names spelled out in white stones.
At the wheel, SOMEONE<Matt> glances over at SOMEONE<Scottie>, who sleeps with her head leaned against the window.
Later in the night, the car's headlights cut through the darkness.
It turns up a driveway,
passing a sign that reads "Hawaii Pacific Institute".
Indoors, three figures step into view in a long corridor.
Overhead fluorescents flicker on.
A woman leads SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Scottie> forward.
SOMEONE<Scottie> hurries ahead and knocks eagerly on a door.
It opens, revealing a sleepy, disheveled teen.
The supervisor wearily leads the visitors down the hall to another door.
A partition slides down, revealing a groggy teen girl putting on glasses.
Now, in the darkness, the dorm supervisor uses a flashlight to lead
SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Scottie> down a long stairway.
They pass through a chain link gate to a driving range.
Two teens flee, one falls.
The girls stagger gripping golf clubs.
SOMEONE<Alex> grins drunkenly.
Grinning, SOMEONE<Alex> points at her father with her golf club.
She turns away and flings it.
Now, SOMEONE<Matt> and his daughters arrive at home.
SOMEONE<Scottie> obeys.
SOMEONE<Matt> carries a passed out SOMEONE<Alex> down a hallway upstairs.
Her arms hug him around the neck and her head rests against his shoulder.
SOMEONE<Matt> brings her into a bedroom and lays her down.
The teen stirs sleepily.
SOMEONE<Matt> guides her raised knees down and covers her with a quilt.
Heading out, he pauses at the door and glances solemnly back at her.
His expression growing resigned, he leaves and shuts the door. In the morning, SOMEONE<Matt> transfers scrambled eggs from a pan onto a plate with toast.
He sets the meal on a table for SOMEONE<Scottie>. She balks.
She pushes the plate away.
As SOMEONE<Matt> takes the plate from the table, SOMEONE<Alex> shuffles in.
Without meeting his gaze, the teen takes a cola from the refrigerator, sits at the table, and slurps sullenly.
SOMEONE<Matt> regards her with a disapproving smirk.
SOMEONE<Matt> tilts his head sheepishly.
SOMEONE<Matt> brings her the untouched breakfast. SOMEONE<Alex> glares at him, glances at the plate, and leaves with an indignant sneer.
SOMEONE follows her outside and finds her on her cellphone,
seated at the edge of an in-ground pool littered with leaves.
SOMEONE<Matt> steps away, picks up a skimmer, and scoops some of the leaves out.
Clad in a bikini, the teen ends her call.
SOMEONE<Scottie> wags her bottom.
Pouting, SOMEONE<Scottie> flips her father the bird and goes inside.
SOMEONE<Alex> gets in the pool.
Treading water, SOMEONE<Alex> stares at her father.
She looks away, stricken.
Blinking back tears, SOMEONE<Alex> meets his imploring gaze.
Surrounding by dead floating leaves, the teen looks away.
She sinks down beneath the water and holds her head in her hands.
Large air bubbles escape her gaping mouth as her body shakes with sobs.
Her features contort fiercely and she swims through the water.
SOMEONE<Matt> walks alongside her as her head emerges.
She climbs out and buries her face in a colorful towel.
Her father approaches with a compassionate frown.
Wheeling around, SOMEONE<Alex> finds him with his arms spread open to her.
She leaves him.
Her father watches her go with a heavy gaze.
fully dressed and curled up on a sofa, SOMEONE<Alex> faces its back and rests her chin on her folded arms. SOMEONE<Matt> walks in.
The girl blinks thoughtfully
as her father takes a seat opposite her,
She curls her neck to look at him.
SOMEONE<Alex> sits up, then scoots around to face him fully. SOMEONE<Matt> blinks quizzically.
He cocks his head.
SOMEONE<Matt> wears a confounded gaze.
He shifts in his chair.
Looking away, SOMEONE<Matt> shakes his head.
He springs to his feet and paces.
The betrayed husband halts.
His back to SOMEONE<Alex>, then turns.
SOMEONE's chest rises and
He registers a hint of a nod.
He has helpless shrug.
He has hands on his hips.
SOMEONE<Matt> turns away and paces restlessly.
His hands curl into fists then release.
Facing SOMEONE<Alex>, he rubs his chin and nose.
He goes out onto the porch and steps into a pair of soft-soled shoes.
He hops and hobbles as he pulls them over his heels one at a time.
Clambering down to his driveway,
SOMEONE<Matt> breaks into a run.
The family man races out of a cul-de-sac and reaches a narrow, rain-soaked road.
He follows it at a sprint, his brow furrowed and his arms pumping furiously.
Running at a stilted, awkward gait,
he reaches a hairpin curve and follows it onto a street canopied with lush trees.
It leads him to a neighborhood nestled by verdant foothills.
Arriving at a two-story house, he passes a little brown goat on his way up the driveway.
Through a window in a cluttered kitchen, we watch him arrive at a door where he lets himself in.
He ventures further into his friend's house.
SOMEONE<Kai> emerges on an upstairs landing.
They join SOMEONE<Matt>.
SOMEONE<Kai> stares wide-eyed at SOMEONE<Matt>.
SOMEONE<Mark> looks away regretfully.
SOMEONE<Kai> heaves a breath.
SOMEONE<Mark> fidgets with his wedding ring.
SOMEONE<Mark> takes a seat and nods.
SOMEONE<Matt> screws his jaw to one side and faces SOMEONE<Kai>.
As SOMEONE<Kai> sinks down in a chair, SOMEONE's<Matt's> gaze softened.
He shrugs a hand helplessly.
SOMEONE<Kai> doubles over, burying her face in her hands as her husband looks on sympathetically.
SOMEONE<Matt> pulls a chair out from a nearby table and sits facing his friends.
He leans forward, his elbows on his knees.
His gaze fixes on SOMEONE<Kai>, then drops morosely.
SOMEONE's<Matt's> eyes glisten and he gives a shaky nod.
He swallows hard and blinks back tears.
With a resigned smirk, his gaze toggles between SOMEONE<Kai> and SOMEONE<Mark>.
SOMEONE<Matt> leaves.
As SOMEONE<Kai> rocks herself, her arms folded, SOMEONE<Mark> gazes remorsefully after his friend.
SOMEONE<Matt> heads down the sun-dappled driveway past the goat.
SOMEONE<Mark> catches up to him.
SOMEONE<Matt> gives a small nod and goes.
SOMEONE<Mark> heads back toward his house.
Now, on a bridge stretching over a sparkling stream, SOMEONE<Matt> weeps into his hand.
He wipes his face.
Keeping his head down, he wipes his eyes and continues across the bridge.
Now he hikes wearily across a healthy lawn bordered by a stone wall.
The stone one meets a second wall of painted cinder block, that's stained along the top with mold.
SOMEONE<Matt> arrives at the cul-de-sac leading to his driveway.
He heads toward his home, passing lush flowering shrubs.
SOMEONE<Matt> turns. He approaches the pool area where his daughters share a lounge chair.
A teen boy reclines in a chair beside them.
SOMEONE<Matt> extends a hand. SOMEONE<Sid> bounds up and clasps it.
He throws an arm around SOMEONE<Matt> in a brotherly hug.
SOMEONE<Matt> faces SOMEONE<Alex>.
SOMEONE<Matt> eyes the teen boy with a skeptical frown.
SOMEONE<Sid> grins and shrugs.
Now, a man's aging hands hold a document headed "Advance Healthcare Directive". The reader, a man with a grey buzz cut, scowls.
SOMEONE<Scott> tosses it down bitterly.
SOMEONE<Matt> subdues a glare.
SOMEONE's<Scott's> chin quivers.
Getting to his feet, the older man steps away from the table in his beige knee socks and sandals.
Wearing a white tee tucked into his khaki shorts, he keeps his back to SOMEONE<Matt>, SOMEONE<Alex>, and SOMEONE<Sid>, who watch him halt on the grass.
SOMEONE's<Scott's> mouth twists in a repressed sob and he rubs his lips back into a stoic line.
His chest rises and falls and he bows his head.
Creasing his lips, he lifts his mournful gaze.
Later, inside, SOMEONE<Scott> gently leads a silver-haired woman by the hand.
She wears a vacant, confused expression as he takes her down a hallway
to a living room where the three visitors wait.
SOMEONE<Sid> remains seated at the far end of the room.
SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Alex> respectfully get to their feet.
He kisses her cheek.
Now standing, SOMEONE<Sid> smiles and waves.
SOMEONE<Scott> eyes him, then faces his wife.
SOMEONE<Scott> storms over to SOMEONE<Sid>, who takes a step back.
SOMEONE<Scott> punches him.
Now, in SOMEONE's<Matt's> car, SOMEONE<Sid> holds frozen peas over his eye.
SOMEONE<Sid> shows his black eye.
SOMEONE<Alex> touches him gently.
SOMEONE<Matt> pulls over.
He wheels around, pointing a finger harshly at SOMEONE<Sid>.
Glaring, SOMEONE<Matt> withdraws his hand and faces SOMEONE<Alex>.
SOMEONE<Matt> contritely lowers his gaze.
SOMEONE<Matt> turns away from the teen and slumps forward morosely.
SOMEONE<Alex> observes her father with a concerned gaze.
Unfastening her seat belt, she leans forward and hugs his seat.
SOMEONE<Matt> raises an eyebrow and blinks at his daughter.
She climbs up.
Now, the car travels along a road overlooking the ocean.
SOMEONE<Matt> the stops the car across from a pleasant mid-century home with a copper turtle on the gate post.
SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Alex> duck down in their seats and discreetly cover their faces. A pickup truck passes by. SOMEONE<Sid> hunches down as well.
All three straighten.
Working his jaw, SOMEONE<Matt> briefly returns his vulnerable gaze to the stranger's house, then droops his head forward.
Seen from a distance,
his car's break lights blink on and he pulls away.
The sedan follows the winding residential road downhill.
traveling through another neighborhood, the car passes a large, beautifully landscaped house on a corner.
The car backs up.
A real estate sign stands posted outside the home's fence of rainbow-shaped rails.
The real estate sign lists the name SOMEONE<Brian> Speer and shows a happy photo of a beady-eyed man with a toothy grin.
At home, trophies, medals, and beaded lace fill a set of shelves.
A central photo shows a smiling SOMEONE<Elizabeth> wearing a race number on her shirt.
SOMEONE<Matt> uses the phone.
Sitting in a day bed with a bottle of Jameson Irish Whisky at his side, SOMEONE<Matt> takes a steadying breath and ends the call.
As he turns off a lamp on a stand, the scene cuts to black.
Now, clouds drift fast across the sky as dawn breaks at a sped up pace.
Two mountains frame a distant view of fast motion traffic on a highway.
Just off a coast dotted with high-rises,
teams of rowers paddle canoes along the rippling turquoise water.
Under a now bright sky, light traffic dots a multi-lane road.
In the city, an American flag and a Hawaiian state flag hang posted on either side of a building's entrance.
In the hospital, a pair of windowed doors show SOMEONE<Matt> arriving with his daughters in tow. He opens one door for them.
They lead the way into the ward.
His daughters gaze after him as he enters SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> room alone.
SOMEONE<Matt> shuts the door behind him, then draws a curtain covering the windows to the ward floor.
He faces his wife.
He glares down at his comatose wife and circles the bed.
His wife lies slack-jawed and motionless.
Leaning close, SOMEONE<Matt> holds an anguished stare.
He straightens, picking up a teddy bear from the bed.
SOMEONE<Matt> starts to gesture with it, then hurls it across the room.
Catching his breath, he smooths his graying hair and steps away.
SOMEONE<Matt> draws himself up and leaves the room.
A regal chipped frame displays a photo of a little girl with golden hair.
On a windowsill, a varsity letter P stands propped against a diploma.
Another photo shows a radiantly smiling SOMEONE<Elizabeth>.
SOMEONE<Alex> ambles into the hospital room, her eyes fixed on her mother.
Reaching the foot of the bed, she glances at SOMEONE<Matt>, then takes another step closer.
Her comatose mother's chest rises and falls under her tracheostomy tube.
He spanks her.
He hustles SOMEONE<Scottie> out of the room.
SOMEONE's<Alex's> glistening eyes glance between her father and mother.
She turns to face to bed.
Later, SOMEONE<Alex> sits next to SOMEONE<Sid>, while SOMEONE<Matt> reads in a chair facing the foot of the bed.
SOMEONE<Scottie> leads a taller girl into the room.
SOMEONE<Sid> gives a halfhearted wave.
SOMEONE<Reina> glances around, then joins her friend at SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> bedside.
SOMEONE<Scottie> nods.
SOMEONE<Reina> exits.
SOMEONE<Alex> eyes her sister.
SOMEONE<Scottie> points to SOMEONE<Alex>, who guiltily averts her gaze.
SOMEONE grabs his cellphone from a counter,
then leans forward heavily.
The display indicates an incoming call from Gold Coast Real Estate.
SOMEONE<Matt> shows the cellphone to SOMEONE<Alex> and her eyes widen.
She grabs it from him and crosses the room.
She hangs up.
Nodding softly, SOMEONE<Matt> shifts his thoughtful gaze.
Now, over a dozen cars fill the King's driveway.
Inside, using chopsticks, people fill their plates with crabs and sushi.
SOMEONE<Mark> and SOMEONE<Kai> peruse the buffet table while other guests convene in the next room.
A woman with short, grey hair chats with some friends.
In the kitchen, SOMEONE<Matt> gazes off sullenly. He takes a sip of scotch.
A teenage boy enters the room and approaches him from behind.
He takes another sip of his drink.
SOMEONE<Matt> shakes his head, struggling to retain his composure.
He chuckles to himself but quickly succumbs to sobs.
The others look on mournfully.
He wipes his nose.
That evening, he crosses the driveway.
He waves to the last departing car as he watches it drive off.
A breeze blows through the bushes flanking the end of the driveway.
Heading back for the house, SOMEONE<Matt> shuffles across the lawn.
He drops to his hands and knees, hanging his head low to the ground.
Sitting back on his ankles, the weary husband rests his hands on his thighs and gazes off pensively.
Now, he sits in his office over a load of paperwork.
They notice the recorder in his hand.
SOMEONE<Alex> lowers her gaze and bites her bottom lip.
Now, as a Hawaiian Airlines jet takes off, the image dissolves to the map of Hawaii with a dashed line leading from Oahu to Kauai.
On the flight, SOMEONE<Alex> chats with SOMEONE<Scottie>.
SOMEONE<Sid> listens to music.
Across the aisle, SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE's black eye.
He turns his wry gaze away and awkwardly finds himself face to face with the large goateed passenger to his left.
SOMEONE<Matt> abruptly faces forward. Later, outside an airport,
a friendly-faced guy comes hurrying over.
Now, a hula girl doll bobbles on the dashboard of a moving vehicle.
The white open-top jeep cruises down a beachside road.
The kids ride in back with the wind in their hair. SOMEONE<Matt> and his cousin sit up front.
The white jeep makes a left turn off the coastal highway onto a side street,
then heads down a dirt road bordered by a wooden fence.
A distant mountain range spans the horizon.
Later, SOMEONE<Matt> chains a metal gate to a wooden post and returns to the jeep, beyond which a herd of cows grazes in a field.
A few cows stand in their way.
Later, the jeep travels a winding dirt path wide enough for only one vehicle.
Our view pulls back to encompass the landscape, which includes lush trees and rolling hills.
Heading uphill, the jeep jostles its passengers.
It reaches the summit of the tree-lined road and rolls to a stop.
SOMEONE<Matt> steps out.
The others climb out as well.
SOMEONE<Matt> shuts his passenger door.
As the group continues up the dirt road, our view turns to follow them.
SOMEONE<Scottie> runs out on a grassy ridge past the corner of an old stone foundation.
They all stop on the scenic overlook.
Below lies a majestic cove of wild undeveloped land.
The tide rolls in gently on the distant beach.
SOMEONE<Matt> glances at SOMEONE<Scottie> with a faint smile, then sighs.
Hovering over the group, our view turns away from the grassy ridge, for a final glimpse of the vast cove and its pristine surroundings.
Now, we pull back from a faux Italian statue of Neptune towering over the center of a fountain, with scalloped ridges evocative of an oyster shell.
The jeep drives by, following a bend in the road.
We drive past a sign for Sandpiper Village, another for Paniolo, then a golf course abutting a housing community.
Riding in the passenger seat, SOMEONE<Matt> holds his forehead as he absently gazes out his window.
The jeep arrives at a hotel, driving past a fountain near the entrance.
Later, at the front desk, SOMEONE<Matt> folds up his wallet.
A clerk looks up the name on his computer.
Now, at the beach, he ambles over to a blanket where Alexandra suns her back and SOMEONE<Scottie> lies with her head on SOMEONE's<Sid's> shoulder.
Her bikini top filled with lumps of sand,
SOMEONE<Scottie> wanders over to the water to shake out the sand.
SOMEONE<Alex> reaches behind her back and fastens her own top as her father takes a seat.
Later, strolling the beach, SOMEONE<Matt> shows SOMEONE<Alex> a photo of SOMEONE<Brian> Speer from a real estate ad.
SOMEONE<Scottie> and SOMEONE<Sid> trail behind SOMEONE<Alex> and SOMEONE<Matt> as they make their way down the wet sand.
We draw back to take in a wide stretch of the shoreline and the misty mountain peaks beyond.
A wide, low-limbed tree shades our view.
The sun sets behind the watery horizon as the foursome continues along the shore toward a distant resort,
the low waves lapping gently at their ankles.
Now, an adults only menu pops up on a TV screen.
SOMEONE<Scottie> mans the remote control as her family finishes dinner in their hotel suite.
SOMEONE<Alex> snatches the remote.
Flailing her arms, SOMEONE<Scottie> prances out of the room.
The frustrated father glances aside, then meets SOMEONE's<Alex's> steady gaze.
SOMEONE<Matt> steps out from a bathroom and shuts off the light.
He plops down on his unmade bed and sits alone in the dark.
Now, SOMEONE<Matt> opens a door and steps into the suite's dark living room.
Shuffling through the shadows, he pauses by a sofa and juts his head forward.
Lying under a blanket on a fold out bed, SOMEONE<Sid> rolls his head to look up at SOMEONE<Matt>.
SOMEONE<Matt> stares at him, then shifts his frustrated gaze and nods.
He switches on a lamp near SOMEONE's<Sid's> pillow.
The teen shuts his eyes, frowning against the light.
SOMEONE<Matt> shakes his head.
He shuffles around the fold out bed, shrugs, and takes a seat.
SOMEONE<Matt> nods thoughtfully.
SOMEONE<Matt> lifts his chin.
SOMEONE<Sid> settles into his pillows.
SOMEONE<Matt> gives a thoughtful nod and regards the teen.
SOMEONE<Sid> offers a kind smile.
SOMEONE<Matt> glances down ponderously, nods again, and trains a warm gaze on the boy.
SOMEONE<Sid> takes a deep breath.
SOMEONE<Sid> hunkers down and pulls his blanket up to his chin.
The lamp blinks off and the scene cuts to black.
Now, on a misty morning, the waves crawl up on the sandy beach beneath an overcast sky.
In a faded black t-shirt, SOMEONE<Matt> jogs along the shoreline. He moves with a rhythmic, purposeful gait, glancing occasionally over the slate-hued water.
Some distance ahead, another jogger approaches.
SOMEONE<Matt> notices dismissively.
As the lanky figure draws near, we recognize SOMEONE's face.
The real estate agent gives a sportsmanlike wave as he passes.
SOMEONE<Matt> returns the gesture, then halts and stares back at him.
His brow knits and he takes off after SOMEONE<Brian>.
He quickens his pace, struggling to catch up to his wife's lover.
But SOMEONE's<Brian's> long-legged stride keeps him several yards ahead.
SOMEONE<Matt> works his way up to a sprint, staring at SOMEONE<Brian> through wild eyes.
The real estate agent turns and trots up the beach toward a row of hedges.
SOMEONE<Matt> pauses, watching him run toward a gate-like gap in the greenery.
As SOMEONE<Brian> passes out of sight, the wronged husband dashes toward the hedge line.
Glancing over his shoulder, he slows, then quickens his pace to a reckless scramble.
He arrives at the hedge and ducks behind it near the gap.
Seen from inside, the gap shows SOMEONE<Matt> darting across to take cover behind the opposite hedge.
He peeks up over the top and finds SOMEONE climbing steps
to a one-story home with a broad roof, a full-length porch, and a sprawling lawn.
SOMEONE stares, only the top half of his face visible,
as SOMEONE<Brian> kicks off his running shoes and goes inside.
Staying put, SOMEONE<Matt> narrows his eyes.
SOMEONE<Brian> comes back out, guzzling water from a bottle.
He descends halfway down the porch steps, then leans back against a supporting pillar.
A pretty woman with strawberry blond hair comes out, trailed by two boys.
They bring plates and cups to a table on the lawn.
SOMEONE's<Matt's> arched eyebrows knit and his eyes narrow.
He slowly sinks out of view.
Now, sitting on a blanket on the beach, SOMEONE<Matt> leans back on his hands.
Beside him, SOMEONE<Alex> lies down and chats with a reclining Sid.
Several yards ahead, SOMEONE's<Scottie's> form bobs in and out of view as she plays in the ocean.
As SOMEONE<Matt> watches her, he shoots frequent glances over his shoulder toward SOMEONE's<Brian's> rental.
Behind him, the strawberry blond emerges with her young boys.
SOMEONE notices, as the boys race to the water.
The woman slows to a walk. Wearing a sun hat and a long-sleeved shirt of sky blue,
she drops a large, fashionable tote in the sand, walks to the water's edge, and cups her hands around her mouth.
The boys splash each other rambunctiously.
SOMEONE<Matt> leans toward SOMEONE<Alex>.
SOMEONE<Alex> rolls over and sits up.
She glances toward SOMEONE<Scottie>, then gazes after her father curiously.
SOMEONE<Matt> meanders down to the water's edge and stops a few feet from the woman.
In her sweater and black bikini bottoms, she watches her boys at play.
The woman grins good-naturedly.
SOMEONE<Matt> bites back a comment and faces the water.
The woman offers a sincere concerned frown.
SOMEONE<Matt> musters a smile.
The mother faces the water.
Watching her, SOMEONE<Matt> adopts a breezy demeanor.
SOMEONE<Matt> twitches himself out of a statue-like hold.
SOMEONE<Scottie> marches from the water.
As SOMEONE<Matt> joins SOMEONE<Scottie>, Mrs. SOMEONE's<Speer's> smile fades and she watches him with a furrowed brow.
Now, shafts of sunlight beam through gaps in the clouds, lighting up patches of the ocean.
In a forest, a rusted metal bridge spans a green brook.
Raindrops plop into the placid water, dotting it with tiny percolations.
Now, SOMEONE<Matt>, his daughters, and SOMEONE<Sid> walk toward an inviting ragtag bungalow with a porch and white-fenced yard.
A sign out front reads "Tahiti Nui Restaurant Cocktail Lounge".
SOMEONE<Scottie> leads the way up to the porch, then through the doorway.
The family pauses near the threshold, taking in the thriving casual hot spot.
On a small stage, three male singers perform on stools as they strum a guitar, a ukulele, and a bass.
Scanning the restaurant, SOMEONE<Matt> spots a man with grey, shoulder-length hair at the bar.
SOMEONE<Matt> sidles down the narrow gap between the bar and a wall, then rounds a corner to the other side and joins SOMEONE<Hugh>.
SOMEONE<Matt> stares confusedly.
SOMEONE<Matt> lowers his thunderstruck gaze, then faces the stage.
SOMEONE<Matt> adopts a nonchalant air. SOMEONE's<Hugh's> easygoing smile fades.
SOMEONE<Matt> regards his cousin with a flinty stare. Looking away, he puts on a smile.
With a worried frown, SOMEONE<Hugh> bridles, and blinks at his cousin.
SOMEONE<Matt> gets up.
The cousins hug and SOMEONE<Hugh> sends SOMEONE<Matt> off with an affectionate rub of the head.
The shell shocked man lumbers across the dining area.
Reaching his table, he collapses into a chair and leans back heavily.
He stares off with glistening eyes.
SOMEONE<Matt> lifts his brow and blinks back his tears.
Taking a breath, he shakes himself out of his thoughts.
SOMEONE<Sid>, who is seated between his daughters, faces us as though we're in SOMEONE's<Matt's> position.
SOMEONE<Scottie> bobs to the music.
SOMEONE<Alex> looks at us.
SOMEONE's<Matt's> looking at us as he replies. His gaze wilts. He glances at the band, then rubs his face.
His weary profile shows against the backdrop of the lively performers. He idly surveys the bar, then peers over his shoulder,
giving us a view of his distracted face head on.
Now, under a dusky sky, SOMEONE<Matt>, his daughters, and SOMEONE<Sid> walk alongside a fence that borders a green field.
Mountains loom in the distance. SOMEONE<Scottie> and SOMEONE<Sid> walk a few paces ahead.
SOMEONE<Alex> bites her lip.
At night, SOMEONE<Sid> addresses SOMEONE<Matt>.
He leaves with SOMEONE<Scottie>.
SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Alex> make their way across the narrow road.
Walking side by side, they advance on the large cottage occupied by the Speers.
Moving around the house, they find Mrs. Speer coming out onto the back porch.
SOMEONE's<Brian's> wife turns.
SOMEONE<Alex> mouths "Howdy".
SOMEONE<Brian> comes out.
SOMEONE's<Brian's> grin falters.
SOMEONE<Julie> goes inside.
SOMEONE<Brian> conjures his toothy grin.
His smile vanishes.
SOMEONE<Brian> responds with a hangdog stare.
Behind SOMEONE<Brian>, indoors, SOMEONE<Julie> gets drinks.
SOMEONE<Julie> returns.
Holding his wife close, SOMEONE<Brian> forces a carefree grin. SOMEONE<Matt> smiles pleasantly.
SOMEONE<Julie> takes SOMEONE's<Alex's> side.
As SOMEONE<Brian> stares after them, SOMEONE<Matt> steps into his line of sight with a firm glare.
The real estate agent obediently opens the screen door. The two men go in.
SOMEONE<Brian> faces SOMEONE<Matt> anxiously.
SOMEONE<Brian> leans on a counter.
SOMEONE's<Brian's> lips form a tearful pout.
SOMEONE<Brian> looks away and licks his lips.
Straightening, he faces SOMEONE<Matt>.
SOMEONE<Brian> draws his dumbfounded mouth shut and nods.
SOMEONE's<Matt's> gaze grows melancholy.
SOMEONE<Brian> looks down shamefully.
SOMEONE<Matt> responds with a bitter sneer and shakes his head.
SOMEONE<Brian> lowers his remorseful gaze and his lips pucker.
SOMEONE<Matt> bristles.
His jaw tightens and he holds SOMEONE<Brian> in a weary, disdainful stare.
He exits the cottage.
As she leans in to hug him, SOMEONE<Matt> tilts his head and gives her a full kiss on the lips instead.
With an intense stare, he heads off, leaving SOMEONE<Julie> confused.
Now, on the flight back, SOMEONE<Matt> stares off pensively.
Sitting behind him, SOMEONE<Alex> scoots forward in her seat and claps a hand on his shoulder.
SOMEONE<Alex> nods faintly. Her father turns away and hangs his head.
In the window seat beside her big sister, SOMEONE sleeps with
a pillow between her head and the wall.
As she stirs a little, getting comfortable, the image dissolves to a corridor in the hospital.
SOMEONE<Matt>, his daughters, and SOMEONE<Sid> trudge in from around a corner.
As the girls approach SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> bed, SOMEONE<Alex> wraps her arm around her sister's shoulders. They gaze at their unresponsive mother.
She lies with each hand curled around a rolled up towel and her mouth hanging slack.
Now, a kind-faced woman addresses SOMEONE<Scottie>.
SOMEONE<Alex>, Dr. SOMEONE<Jonhston>, and SOMEONE<Matt> look on from in front of SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> bed.
The grief counselor's lips form a sympathetic line.
SOMEONE's<Scottie's> eyes fill with tears and she turns to her father.
Seeing his woeful look, she lowers her gaze.
The kind-faced counselor strokes SOMEONE's<Scottie's> arm.
Her lips trembling, the girl turns back to face her.
As the counselor continues speaking, SOMEONE's<Scottie's> face crumples in anguish.
The bereaved little girl watches the woman leave with Dr. SOMEONE<A>,
then embraces her father, burying her face in his chest.
He kisses the top of her head.
He caresses her hair, then tilts her face up to meet his gaze.
SOMEONE<Alex> gently slides her hands down her sister's ponytail.
Cradling SOMEONE's head,
SOMEONE<Matt> lifts his eyes to his older daughter.
SOMEONE<Alex> pushes out a breath and shifts her attention to her mother.
Later, our view shifts from SOMEONE's bed
to SOMEONE<Matt> doing paperwork and SOMEONE<Alex> and SOMEONE<Sid> reading books.
From the corridor, SOMEONE<Scott> peers into the room, then enters with his wife and son behind him.
SOMEONE<Matt> sets aside his work.
He and SOMEONE<Alex> hug SOMEONE<Barry> and his frail mother.
As SOMEONE<Alex> leads her uncle and grandmother to SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> bedside, SOMEONE<Scott> shifts his gaze to SOMEONE<Sid>.
The boy gives him a sullen look, then turns away.
SOMEONE<Matt> scowls at his father-in-law, then stares off bitterly.
Closing his eyes, he lets his head droop.
A faint smile briefly plays on SOMEONE's<Matt's> face as he gives the teens a surprised look.
SOMEONE<Scott> shrugs his lips, then joins his family at SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> bedside.
SOMEONE<Matt> gestures to SOMEONE<Alex> and SOMEONE<Sid> and they follow him into the corridor.
He pulls the door closed.
Opening the door a crack, SOMEONE<Matt> peeks back into the room.
SOMEONE<Alex> and SOMEONE<Sid> move in close to him and they all spy on standing at his daughter's bedside.
The grief-stricken man gives a helpless shrug,
then leans over SOMEONE<Elizabeth> and strokes her hair.
The three outside watch sympathetically.
Resting his hand on his daughter's head, SOMEONE<Scott> bends down and gives her a light kiss on the cheek.
The onlookers watch him whisper "I love you".
He continues caressing his daughter's hair.
Tightening his lips defeatedly, he withdraws his hand.
He lifts his gaze from his dying daughter and glances, unfocused, toward the doorway.
In the morning, sunlight peeks through a blanket of clouds
and shines down on a lush mountain ridge.
At home, SOMEONE<Matt> sleeps with his face resting on his cluttered desk.
One of his fingers twitches and he awakes.
With a frown, he sits up.
Blinking groggily, he looks at his watch, then leans forward on his elbows and shifts his thoughtful eyes.
He pushes his chair back from the desk and rises.
He exits past the portraits of his great great grandparents.
The image dissolves to a sprawling wind-blown property.
SOMEONE’s<Matt’s> car glides toward a fork in a long driveway.
To one side lies a large ranch style house and a tennis court.
On the other, grazing ducks scatter as SOMEONE<Matt> pulls over onto a well-manicured lawn and parks.
Now, he enters the large house, allowing sunlight to filter through the screen door into the unlit living room.
As he pushes open the curtains on the front windows,
more daylight washes over a wall decorated with framed photos.
He strolls past it,
then stops and gazes at the black and white images of his ancestors.
A mustached man gives a serious look. Another shows a frizzy-haired woman.
In a third photo, four men in suits stand on a building's front steps.
Behind the glass of a large frame, wooden block letters spell out "Kikila". Above an antique photo of a man with a mutton chop beard, a plaque beside it reads "Cecil Kikila King. the namesake of this beautiful place. He was a prominent attorney, banker, and socialite in old Hawaii. ".
SOMEONE<Matt> eyes more photos of family members throughout the years. two men and two women in 1920s era garb.
Leaving the photos, SOMEONE<Matt> steps out onto the lawn.
A group of about 40 suddenly fades into view -
some at picnic tables, others standing around chatting.
One of the King cousins breaks off from the socializing to place a folded slip of paper in a large wooden bowl,
then sets down a pen.
SOMEONE<Ralph> laughs.
Wink smokes a cigar.
SOMEONE<Hugh> talks with SOMEONE<Matt>.
Dogs laze about in the grass at their owner's feet.
Two more cousins drop off folded slips of paper into the wooden bowl.
Now, SOMEONE<Matt> stares off with doleful eyes as he sits at a table.
SOMEONE<Hugh> unfolds a ballot and reads it.
He hands SOMEONE<Matt> paperwork.
He offers a pen.
Frowning, SOMEONE<Matt> takes it, then flips through the paperwork.
SOMEONE<Milo> and SOMEONE<Hugh> watch with encouraging smiles.
SOMEONE<Matt> thoughtfully hovers his pen over the blank signature line.
He gazes at the documents.
SOMEONE<Hugh> furrows his bushy eyebrows.
SOMEONE<Matt> glances at his two cousins, then looks back at the contract and shakes his head.
SOMEONE<Hugh> and SOMEONE<Milo> give him shocked looks.
SOMEONE<Hugh> glances at SOMEONE<Milo>, then shakes his head with a frustrated smile.
Tossing the documents aside, he gives his cousins a resolute look.
SOMEONE<Milo> lifts his brow and shares a thoughtful glance with SOMEONE<Hugh>.
The long-haired, heavyset cousin smirks disapprovingly at SOMEONE<Matt>.
He rubs his nose then stands.
The crowd looks over.
He slaps SOMEONE's<Matt's> shoulder.
Rising from his chair, SOMEONE<Matt> faces the group and gives them a nod.
They all watch him expectantly.
The scene in front of him fades to SOMEONE's hospital room, where our view edges closer to the back of his head
as he watches his family.
Now, we travel up the bed quilt to SOMEONE's hands
still curled loosely around the towel rolls.
Just above the neckline of her hospital gown,
a gauze dressing covers the stoma in her trachea,
its center dampened with a moist circle.
Her mouth hangs open, her lips dry and slightly parched,
while her head lies tilted to one side.
On a couch, SOMEONE<Scottie> lies asleep.
SOMEONE<Sid> sits lazily in a chair with one leg crooked upward as he somberly does homework.
Slouched in another seat, SOMEONE<Alex> stares at her dying mother.
Our view drifts closer to her plaintive face as she blinks tears from her eyes.
As the door opens, SOMEONE peers over her shoulder and sees a woman entering,
her face obscured by a large bouquet held in front of it.
SOMEONE<Matt> stares with surprised eyes.
Lowering the flowers, SOMEONE<Julie> Speer glances between him and SOMEONE<Alex>.
The teen shoots her father a questioning look.
SOMEONE<Matt> stands.
SOMEONE<Julie> forces a pained smile.
She puts on her shoes.
SOMEONE<Julie> flashes a polite smile at SOMEONE<Alex>, who follows SOMEONE<Scottie> and SOMEONE<Sid> out.
SOMEONE<Matt> opens his mouth as if to speak, then shrugs his hands.
He and SOMEONE<Julie> turn toward SOMEONE<Elizabeth>.
She gives him a pointed look
and he nods sadly.
SOMEONE<Matt> glances uncertainly at his wife.
Shifting her tearful eyes to SOMEONE<Elizabeth>, SOMEONE<Julie> steps to her side.
While SOMEONE watches from the foot of the bed,
SOMEONE's<Julie's> face contorts in anguish as she gazes at the comatose woman.
She stares down at SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> frozen, slack-jawed expression.
SOMEONE<Matt> nods empathetically.
SOMEONE<Matt> gently takes her arm, guides her to the door, then stops and meets her gaze.
With a nod, SOMEONE<Matt> opens the door for her.
SOMEONE<Matt> shuts it and sighs.
He turns his back to the door and stares across the room at SOMEONE<Elizabeth> in her bed.
Remaining fixed on her, SOMEONE draws and expels a deep breath,
then ambles across the room and stands at her bedside.
The middle-aged man's weary gaze grows affectionate as he reaches out to her.
Looking over her frail form, he breathes softly.
His fingers caress the pale woman's hair just above her forehead.
With a fond look in his eyes,
he smiles.
He bends down and leans over her, his fingers lingering on her brow.
He gives her a long, gentle kiss on the lips, then remains
hovering just inches above her.
A tear rolls down his nose.
In a waiting area, SOMEONE sits beside her father with tears in her eyes.
Our view drifts to SOMEONE's<Matt's> weary face as he stares across the room.
The door to SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> room opens.
SOMEONE steps out, her eyes puffy and red.
SOMEONE<and> crosses the hallway toward her family.
SOMEONE<Matt> rises from his chair and faces her.
SOMEONE<Alex> hugs her father.
Resting her chin on his shoulder, she gazes upward.
He kisses her temple, then stands aside as she crosses to SOMEONE<Sid>.
She gives her shaggy-haired friend a hug.
Peering over his shoulder with her arm wrapped around his neck.
SOMEONE<Alex> faces her younger sister.
Gazing up from her chair, SOMEONE<Scottie> purses her lips.
SOMEONE<Alex> offers her hands, then guides her sister up from her seat.
She wraps her arm around the girl and they head off together.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch SOMEONE lead SOMEONE across the hallway
SOMEONE lead SOMEONE into SOMEONE's room.
Now, a puffy cumulus cloud dominates the lower half of a sky view.
Its vapor edge forms fanciful bulges and dips across the blueness green vegetation blankets a mountain range.
On the yet unsold land, the overlook offers a majestic view of the cove and the meadows and wild groves inland of it.
Beyond a line of breaking waves, vibrant shades of ocean blue extend to the horizon meeting powder blue sky.
The blossoms of a plumeria flutter in a breeze, their petals in shades of yellow and pink.
Now, sitting aboard an outrigger canoe, SOMEONE<Alex> nods and accepts a container.
She wears a pink and white lei around her neck.
SOMEONE<Matt> watches his daughter from across the boat, wearing a lei of autumn colors.
They float about a mile from the urban coastline.
SOMEONE<Alex> draws a scoop of ashes from the container and looks at her father.
He shifts his serene gaze, then gives her a soft nod.
The peaceful young woman looks at the ashes and purses her lips.
Sitting in the middle of the boat,
SOMEONE<Scottie> watches her sister pour the scoop of ashes into the water.
SOMEONE<Alex> hands the container to her.
They younger girl tearfully takes hold of the scoop handle, but lets go of it and passes the canister on to SOMEONE<Matt>.
The middle-aged widower gazes at the gray dust.
A skyward view from the ashes shows a breeze blowing through his grey hair.
The girls watch as he holds the container over the side of the boat
and pours the rest of SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> ashes into the sea.
He taps the container against the side of the canoe to empty it completely.
SOMEONE<Matt> watches the ashes mix with the water, then glances at his daughters.
He takes off his lei and sets it on the water.
SOMEONE<Alex> and SOMEONE<Scottie> do the same.
They watch their leis floating beside the boat, bobbing on the surface.
Seen from underwater, the leis show in silhouette against the gleaming sunlight.
They take on amoeba-like shapes as they float beside the canoe.
SOMEONE<Scottie> lies on the couch under a blanket.
Beyond the couch, SOMEONE steps out from an arched doorway with two bowls. In shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, SOMEONE<Matt> joins SOMEONE<Scottie> and hands her one of the bowls.
SOMEONE<Matt> sits on the couch and rests his feet on an ottoman.
As they eat their ice cream, SOMEONE<Alex> enters the distant dining room and digs through a bag on the table.
SOMEONE<Matt> adjusts the end of SOMEONE's<Scottie's> blanket and covers his legs.
SOMEONE<Alex> notices them from the dining room and strides observantly through an archway.
Arms folded, she halts behind the ice cream eating pair.
SOMEONE drops her arms to her sides, then steps around the couch and takes a seat
beside her father, forcing him more into the middle as she takes a corner of the blanket.
As they remain focused on their movie, SOMEONE<Matt> helps SOMEONE<Alex> lay the blanket over her legs.
He hands her his bowl of ice cream and she rests it on her lap.
As the trio watch the movie together,
Now, in reality.
The rugged man descends courthouse stairs and encounters several journalists.
They follow outside.
He walks off in the rain.
Later he enters a coffee shop.
He takes a seat.
Dawning glasses he peruses a file as the news broadcasts behind him.
He whirls around to watch Wennerstrom's statement.
The barista sets the items on the counter. Later SOMEONE stands outside in the shelter of the coffee shops entryway.
He opens the Marlboros, puts one between his lips and throws the rest of the pack away.
SOMEONE lights the cigarette, then takes a deep satisfied drag.
The journalist runs across the street to a building. A sign near its entrance reads Millennium.
Inside, he arrives at a suite door bearing the same title.
As he enters, a staff of employees halt and face him.
He shrugs his brow grimly and goes upstairs to an office. Inside, a lovely blonde in her 40s steps away from her desk and regards him sympathetically.
A staffer arrives, but the woman sends him away with a gesture.
As SOMEONE steps further in, she shuts the door.
SOMEONE meets her gaze and his expression softens wearily.
His colleague steps close and intimately nuzzles her forehead against his.
Now a bespectacled old man waits in a conference room with a stylish businessman.
Outside, a woman wearing a helmet arrives on a motorcycle.
Sporting a Mohawk, she rides an elevator.
Spikes with spiraled ends impale her earlobes. Using keycards she passes purposefully through a series of doors.
She hesitates seeing the two men in the glass walled room. She sports eyebrow, nose, and lip rings amid her delicate features. Her boss waves her in.
Both men stand. Dressed in black with a matching leather jacket she enters avoiding their gaze and takes a seat at the far end of the conference table.
She sits hunched, turned slightly away.
She faces SOMEONE.
She turns away, giving him a full view of her black spikey Mohawk.
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE who wearily meets his gaze.
She stares through darkly lined eyes.
Now, in a working class high-rise she dumps packaged noodles into a bowl.
A cigarette dangles from her lips. As she runs the bowl under a tap.
She thrusts it into a microwave oven,
then takes a can of coke from her fridge.
Heading into the next room.
SOMEONE sits facing a laptop.
She goes to a Vanger Industries page profiling SOMEONE, then hacks into SOMEONE's email account.
As SOMEONE goes back to the kitchen, a new email pops up.
We glimpse its content.
Dear Mr. SOMEONE, Are you available for an interview regarding the Wennerstrom verdict?
Returning with her steaming noodles, SOMEONE runs a Google search on Wennerstrom.
It leads her to a Wikipedia page. SOMEONE Googles Wennerstrom + Vanger Industries.
A webpage mentions his previous work in the financial division.
Now, at a Christmas gathering, SOMEONE faces his lover, her husband and a brunette.
SOMEONE notices a teen with dark hair watching him. He joins her.
SOMEONE takes an uneasy breath and sips red wine.
Now, in a coat and knit hat, SOMEONE lights a cigarette as she walks down a sidewalk.
She pauses within earshot of a building entrance.
Listening as a richly dressed older woman punches in an entry code.
As the woman goes in, SOMEONE loiters briefly.
The ends of her black hair stick out from under her hat.
Framing her jaw and chin.
SOMEONE goes to the keypad, enters the code, and goes inside.
She pauses, looking around, then climbs a marble staircase to a posted directory.
As the steps away we find Wennerstrom listed on the sixth level.
Now, SOMEONE enters a basement area with rough stonewalls.
She comes to the building's electrical center and photographs the circuit boxes, meters, and wiring.
she takes a photo of an Ethernet hub.
she steps back out onto the sidewalk.
She turns abruptly as a car pulls up.
Looking over her shoulder, she spies Wennerstrom getting out.

SOMEONE checks her cell phone then puts it down.
Throughout the party, other guests do the same.

Revealing an oversized shirt with a hem just below her hips.
She finds SOMEONE at a laptop in the next room.
Sitting in his briefs, SOMEONE turns to face her.
She steps away.
SOMEONE slams his computer shut.
Now in a blizzard, a train travels a mountainous snow dusted landscape.
In a passenger car set with small tables, SOMEONE sits opposite two strangers. His gaze pensive.
He rolls his head against his seatback.
Watching trees pass the window.
the train stops at a platform marked, SOMEONE disembarks.
Shivering, he walks to the edge of the platform.
Waiting beside a nearby car, SOMEONE waves.
Now, on a narrow snow smeared road, the car approaches a bridge with rainbow-shaped arches barely wide enough for two cars.
The snow picks up again as the car turns down a road bordered with tall skeletal trees.
As SOMEONE drives the journalist over the grounds of an estate.
The blizzard drives a heavy snowfall almost sideways.
SOMEONE leans forward peering through the windshield with narrowed eyes.
In the distance, twin lights barely pierce the storm on either side of the road.
The car passes through a gate set with glowing lamps.
Then approaches a sprawling elegant manor house with a circular driveway.
As it pulls up next to a utilitarian pickup with a covered bed,
the distinguished figure of SOMEONE Vanger comes outside to greet them.
SOMEONE takes them into a cozy study and gestures SOMEONE to a leather armchair.
The journalist sits facing his host.
With a friendly pat, SOMEONE dismisses SOMEONE.
Now, a heavyset techie in a Nine Inch Nails shirt lets SOMEONE into his apartment.
She hands him some money and he examines it.
She holds out her hand to take it back but he instead gives her an electronic device with a screen, antenna, and attached wire.
SOMEONE glances at the heavyset techie, then walks out the door.
She eyes him and shuts the door. A flashback shows a young woman on the beach.
SOMEONE studies a photo.
SOMEONE removes a school photo from an album.
SOMEONE stares at the photo.
In a flashback, children play outside the house.

He switches on a shadeless lamp then gestures to a wall.
SOMEONE views more than a dozen pressed and framed wildflowers, mounted meticulously on a wall in a tidy grid.
A second grid of the artwork covers another wall.
And several unmounted frames lean on the wall.
SOMEONE returns his gaze to the wildflowers.
A train leaves Hedestad station where a clock reads 4:30.
Later, at dinner with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE pours wine.
He sips his wine. SOMEONE's jaw hangs slack.
Now, pedestrians cross paths outside SOMEONE's apartment building.
In the rough stone basement,
holding a flashlight between her teeth,
SOMEONE sets her handheld device on top of an electrical box.
Then connects its wire to a circuit.
She takes the flashlight out of her mouth and flips a switch. Then shoulders her bag and heads out.
At the Millennium offices, SOMEONE's co-editor enters with a cup of coffee.

He walks out the door. She watches him go with a disappointed gaze.
Now, at a coffee shop SOMEONE sits alone at a counter with a book decorated with a bow.
SOMEONE Fischer: My 60 Memorable Games.
She peels off a price tag, then checks her cell phone.
She sets it down and glances around.
Now, she marches across a street to a five-story brick facade with bay windows shaped like prisms.
Inside, she approaches an apartment door.
She leans towards the door and listens.
She opens the door and steps inside.
She walks deeper into the apartment and looks around. Then drops her bag,
rushes to an elderly man on the floor and checks his pulse. She hurries out of the room as he remains motionless on his side.
Now, at the Hedestad station, a thermometer nears negative 20 degrees Celsius.
SOMEONE exits a train with his bags and reacts to the cold.
He steps away from the train and waves to a driver waiting outside a taxi.
Later, the taxi drives over the multispan rainbow arch bridge from the mainland to the island.
At the guest cottage, SOMEONE pays the driver then slips on an icy stoop.
The driver gets back in his taxi.
As he carries his luggage inside, The driver pulls out.
Driving up a one-lane road made visible by two tire tracks in the snow,
the taxi passes SOMEONE's house.
Inside, as SOMEONE tries to make a call on his cell phone,
he scans a toilet, tub, and table in a bathroom.
Attempting another call, he crosses to a bedroom where pillows and folded towels lie stacked at the foot of the bed.
SOMEONE looks over his shoulder then crosses to a window where a Tabby waits on the sill in the cold.
He lets the cat inside and it jumps down to the floor.
He steps past the cat and opens a refrigerator but finds it empty.
He shuts the fridge and shares a look with the hungry cat.

Avoiding his gaze, SOMEONE clenches her jaw.
He folds his hands.
He consults her file.
She stares off.
Lowering her steely eyes, SOMEONE sucks in a breath.
Under her new guardian's menacing gaze she works her lips, struggling to remain composed.
Now, SOMEONE hurries out of the office and steps into an elevator. As the door slides shut a view through its window shows her enraged face.
In Hedestad a Volvo stops beside SOMEONE as he trudges up a hill.
Now the car glides up a long driveway to a sleek glass-walled home.

Now, at SOMEONE's.
A caretaker removes a tray from the table in front of the blank faced man.
Sitting diagonally beside her former guardian, SOMEONE wipes drool from his mouth with her sleeve.
As she watches him, SOMEONE's absent stare remains ahead.
The young woman looks away.
Later, she rides an escalator down into a subway station. A train glides up.
As she approaches the platform a guy snatches her backpack off her shoulder.
She sees him racing to the escalator.
As he rides up, SOMEONE sprints after him and grabs her bag.
She and the thief tug it back and forth
fighting for control, and she punches him in the face.
He falls to the escalator's gliding steps.
Grabbing him by the lapels she leans over him, her face contorted with rage.
The thief grabs the bag again and she kicks him.
As he reaches for her she rolls onto the inclined metal barrier between the ascending and descending escalators.

Her brow furrowed thoughtfully,
she gazes around the room, then removes her shoes and casually tosses them aside.

As SOMEONE<Mike> leans her against the basket's edge, the pilot looks on anxiously.
Keeping his lips locked on SOMEONE's,<Abby's,> SOMEONE<Mike> dismisses him with a wave.

Later in a principal's office.
his son sits beside him.
He strides to an open awning window which jiggles in the wind. Steadying it, he takes out a tool on his keychain.
Entering the office, the principal furrows his brow as he sees SOMEONE fiddling with his window.
He beckons SOMEONE into the hall and leads him past artwork posted above the lockers.
A drawing shows a man with his head flying off his sliced neck.
He holds SOMEONE's gaze. With concerned looks, both men shift their eyes back to SOMEONE's drawing, where the bald 	decapitated man's tongue juts from his mouth in agony, as his head flies away from his body.
Blood spurts from his sliced neck and drips from slashes along his jawline.
The principal shoots the father a horrified glance, then heads off.
Turning thoughtfully to his son, SOMEONE sees him leaning against the bank of lockers with his arms crossed. The 	teen stares back at him broodingly.

The teen's hand rests on a leather-bound book resembling a journal.
Entering the room, SOMEONE gently lifts his son's hand and takes the book.
He sits on the edge of the bed and shoots SOMEONE a perplexed glance.
Furrowing his brow, he opens the book to a pair of skillfully drawn sketches.
One shows a bald burly man with a menacing look
and the other depicts a hollow-cheeked face
with a grim expression.
Dark-smudged pencil work creates gloomy shading around both figures.
Nodding, SOMEONE turns the page. In the next sketch, a boy sits with his elbows on a table, his face buried in his hands.
At the center of the table, tiny people stand around a gaping chasm.
The sketch on the opposite page shows a woman cradling a baby while a figure watches from a doorway.
Flipping to the next two pages,
SOMEONE finds a drawing filling up both sides.
In it, an anguished three-eyed face lets out a scream, its red uvula visible through its gaping mouth. SOMEONE sets 	the sketchbook aside and caresses his son's shaggy brown bangs.
Later in a bathroom, he dabs his mouth with a towel and wipes his hands, then lifts his eyes to a mirror above the 	sink.

SOMEONE flips to another listing in the binder. They drive past a plain-gray, two-story home with red trim.
They pass a cozy-looking white house with an ivy-covered chimney.
Flipping through the binder, SOMEONE furrows his brow. They pull up in front of a ranch-style house with a yard 	covered in native-California plants.
SOMEONE holds out a listing.
They drive up a rustic tree-lined road.
Gazing out her window, SOMEONE smiles. Up ahead, the house lies shrouded behind a cluster of mature trees. A slack-	jawed SOMEONE eyes the large property.
The car parks alongside an old wooden fence. We glimpse the sun through a canopy of tree branches,
then find SOMEONE riding on her father's shoulders, aiming her camera at the quaint two-story Colonial house.
SOMEONE heads inside.
He looks around the spacious, mostly empty rooms.
He follows SOMEONE upstairs.

ambles to the railing with his hands stuffed in his pockets, and listens.

In a pub, young men and women cheer on SOMEONE as he drains a yard glass of beer.
SOMEONE laughs and lifts her arms as he finishes.
A SOMEONE slaps his back.
SOMEONE stumbles down off a chair and SOMEONE hugs him.
As he swaggers toward the bar, MacTaggert intercepts him.
SOMEONE lays fingertips against his temple and gazes thoughtfully at her.
Beyond the agent, the bar dissolves into images of SOMEONE, SOMEONE Frost in her diamond form, and SOMEONE appearing.
SOMEONE lowers his hand.
SOMEONE lowers her gaze.
Now words appear beneath a dock. Miami, Florida. On a yacht.
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, who reclines on a lounge chair.
As the cyclone-making mutant approaches, SOMEONE produces a grenade.
SOMEONE hooks his finger around the grenade's pin.
Peering at him through dark sunglasses, SOMEONE coolly strolls up to the military commander.
He reaches out and pries the explosive from SOMEONE's grasp.
SOMEONE gives a smirk.
SOMEONE shifts anxiously on his feet as SOMEONE pulls the pin.
SOMEONE looks on calmly.
A fiery blast blots him from view, then shrinks. SOMEONE's clothes flutter as he contains the explosion between his hands, then absorbs it.
He taps SOMEONE's shoulder. From the point of contact, radiant energy expands and consumes his form. At CIA headquarters.
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
He eyes SOMEONE.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE swap looks.
Seated by SOMEONE, SOMEONE bolts to her feet and assumes the middle-aged jowly form of Agent SOMEONE.
She smiles at the staring slack-jawed agent with his face.
Dark scales flutter around her figure in waves as she shifts into her natural blue form.
SOMEONE drily faces SOMEONE and SOMEONE.
A portly man in black, seated in a corner, speaks up.
Later in a hallway,
he freezes at a water fountain.
The arching water grazes his nose.
Now in a parking structure.
Nighttime. SOMEONE's anchored yacht looms before us,
its polished hull reading, "Caspartina."
From the rippling water below, SOMEONE's head emerge
He gazes intently at the extravagantly large luxury craft.
Later in a wetsuit, he creeps onboard.
Taking cover, he draws the Nazi's Blood and Honor knife from a boot sheath.
SOMEONE stalks out onto the main deck.
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the cyclone-maker stand.
Little SOMEONE Lensherr.
SOMEONE grins at the intruder.
SOMEONE's eyes narrow.
SOMEONE clutches his head and drops to his knees, as memories of SOMEONE torturing him flood his mind.
SOMEONE remembers his mother screaming.
After all these year
he relives SOMEONE murdering her.
SOMEONE throws the knife.
Taking her diamond form, SOMEONE catches it.
SOMEONE springs to his feet, but she punches him overboard.
She turns back to flesh and blood.
A military ship approaches.
Ahead of the ship, three motorized inflatable boats carry armed soldiers toward the yacht.
SOMEONE narrows her eyes and our view of her fragments.
the motorized boats near the yacht, kicking up spray in their wake.
The cyclone-maker steps to the edge of the yacht deck and a whirlwind springs from each of his hands. He hurls them at the oncoming boats.
On the ship's deck, SOMEONE gawks.
The whirlwind knocks the boats high in the air.
In the water, SOMEONE lifts his arms. The yacht's anchor chains rise all around him. In a ship corridor.
Recovering, SOMEONE marches back out on the deck and points.
One of the yacht's anchors rises high above its deck.
SOMEONE thrusts a hand forward.
The anchor swoops down, crashes through the smokestack, and plows through the upper deck. It rises high as SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the man in black stare.
SOMEONE whips the anchor chain around the yacht's corridors.
Inside, SOMEONE and SOMEONE flee down a hallway as the chain slices through the walls. The upper cabins collapse in its wake.
SOMEONE flings an arm and the anchor snaps loose.
Our view sinks beneath the water to find a hatch in the yacht's underside releasing a submarine.
Treading water, SOMEONE turns. As the underwater vessel pulls away, he grits his teeth and stretches his hands after it.
The submarine shakes, but continues through the water as SOMEONE and his followers reach an all-white state-of-the-art bridge.
Water surges around SOMEONE's head as the vessel drags him in its wake.
On the ship, sailors gather on the decks.
The submarine drags SOMEONE beneath the water.
Completely submerged, he bares his gritted teeth, and keeps a stubborn hold on the submarine.
On the ship, SOMEONE runs along the deck, then dives from the edge. He plunges into the water behind SOMEONE and wraps his arms around him.
Two veins throb in SOMEONE's forehead as SOMEONE drags him toward the surface. In the escaping submarine, SOMEONE shifts his smug gaze.
The two mutants surface.
SOMEONE smiles warmly at him.
The haunted man regards him with a furrowed brow.
As we drift over a sprawling complex, words appear: "Covert CIA Research Base."
On a lawn, a sphere stands on a pedestal, resembling a giant golf ball on a tee.
At a bustling entrance, a black car pulls up.
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, the man in black, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE get out.
Now a bespectacled young man shows a model of the stealth jet.
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
The man in black steps closer, his head cocked.
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE.
The slim charmingly disheveled young man shifts his uncertain gaze.
He gives a little shrug of the head, then kicks off his shoes.
He peels off his socks,
revealing large feet with long prehensile toes,
including opposable big toes.
SOMEONE notices the blonde SOMEONE beaming radiantly at him.
He smiles pleasurably, then scoots past the group.
He leaps up, backflips, and catches hold of the model jet with his feet.
He hangs upside down.
He swings gently as his feet grip the model tightly.
He stares, slack-jawed.
Smiling warmly, SOMEONE steps in close to SOMEONE.
Now a TV in a living room shows a news broadcast.
SOMEONE skeptically cocks her head.
SOMEONE crosses to a large hard case sitting on a desk.
He opens it and pulls out a sleek shiny helmet the color of pewter
designed to cover the entire head.
Steel-hued trim frames its specialized facial opening.
He puts it on, leaving only his eyes, nose, mouth, and chin exposed.
As SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, she exhales and lowers her chin.
She stares piercingly at SOMEONE, her eyes narrowing.
Relaxing, she tilts her head and cocks an eyebrow.
SOMEONE beams gratefully.
SOMEONE holds up a glass of liquor.
SOMEONE's smile fade
She takes the glass and crosses the stylish room to a hatch.
Opening the door, she heads into the submarine bridge.
SOMEONE and the cyclone-maker lower a ladder for her.
Now standing in an open upper hatch, SOMEONE's diamond hand cuts a plum-sized chunk of ice from a large formation.
As it plops into SOMEONE's drink,
we drift back and find the sub in the midst of a frozen sea.
In a recess at the lab, SOMEONE sits facing SOMEONE.
SOMEONE leans in close.
She lays her forearm across his lap.
SOMEONE rolls up her sleeve and swabs at a patch of her skin with a cotton ball.
He picks up a syringe and injects the needle into her vein.
SOMEONE winces.
She brings her full parted lips in toward his.
She straightens abruptly as SOMEONE strolls over.
SOMEONE presses his lips shut and swallow
SOMEONE stares after SOMEONE as he saunters off, then faces SOMEONE.
The young man licks his lips and shifts his uneasy gaze.
Now in a dimly lit office, SOMEONE searches a file cabinet.
He brings out a folder, glances over his shoulder, and studies its cover.
It bears the CIA emblem,
SOMEONE's name, and a file number.
SOMEONE puts it in a briefcase.
Later he exits
the complex, passing SOMEONE.
SOMEONE keeps his back to SOMEONE, his gaze vulnerable.
He smiles bitterly.
He faces the compassionate young man.
SOMEONE stands motionless, his wary gaze fixed on SOMEONE.
SOMEONE backs away a few feet, then turns and heads toward the building.
SOMEONE looks away, uncertain.
Now SOMEONE looks at the giant golf-ball-like structure.
SOMEONE smile
With a nod, SOMEONE eyes the man in black.
SOMEONE considers SOMEONE.
The supervising agent gapes.
As the man in black holds SOMEONE's smug gaze, our view zooms out a window, which frames the transmitter.
Now SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE find SOMEONE inside the transmitter's spherical room.
SOMEONE pulls on a helmet attached to a network of wire
SOMEONE flips switches on a control board as SOMEONE waits atop a circular platform at the room's center.
Furrowing his brow, SOMEONE scrutinizes his telepathic colleague.
As SOMEONE closes his eyes, SOMEONE watches with an anxious look.
SOMEONE flips more switches and a strip of paper begins to move like a conveyor belt under the arms of a chart recorder.
White light glows down on SOMEONE.
He clutches railings at his sides. His chest heaves as he envisions shooting into the air past hundreds of humans. Emerging on a blanket of clouds, his gaze sweeps from three girls, to a man reading a book, to a dark-skinned girl with white hair.
He smiles.
SOMEONE finds a girl being examined by an eye doctor.
In the transmitter, SOMEONE watches a printer.
SOMEONE grins.
His mind's eye zooms from person to person in the clouds,
then focuses on a black-haired young woman in booty shoots and a bra with dangling fringe.
The clouds clear away to show her standing on a bar in a night club.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE now sit in front of her.
SOMEONE shows her some money.
Later in a private room, SOMEONE and SOMEONE clink their glasses.
SOMEONE snaps and an ice bucket with champagne rises.
As they look at her, the young woman twitches a smile.
Reaching behind her back,
she unhooks her bra and a web-like tattoo of four dragonfly wings morphs into real ones. As they flutter rapidly, the young woman rises into the air.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE exchange an amazed look, then return their attention to the hovering dancer.
Back at the transmitter, the printer types more coordinates.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE climb into a cab.
SOMEONE guides the meter's arm down. Later the recruiters walk a prison corridor.
The warden opens a cell.
Sitting on a bench inside, a brawny young man with blonde hair lifts his gaze.
Now in an aquarium, a teenaged boy and girl face a fish tank.
The pretty teen gives him a haughty look.
As she turns away, the shaggy-haired boy blows at the tank.
The water inside ripples, driving the fish off.
The girl turns back to the tank and finds all of the fish gone.
With a perplexed look, she hurries off.
As the boy turns back to the tank, SOMEONE and SOMEONE step up behind him.
Later the recruiters enter a pub where Logan sits at the bar.
They approach the troubled man as he lifts a cigar to his lips.
Logan puffs on his cigar and the two recruiters exchange a resigned look.
As they head out the door, he stares over his shoulder after them, then downs his drink and gestures for another.
Now a view through a periscope sweeps across a vacant ocean.
Inside SOMEONE's sub, SOMEONE removes her eyes from the viewfinder and turns to SOMEONE.
Striding out of the bridge, she enters the adjacent living room and office area.
She opens a small metal box on a desk and pushes a button inside.
Two sections of wall separate to reveal a secret doorway.
Entering a room covered in mirrored panels, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE staring down at a waist-high nuclear reactor.
SOMEONE's chest heaves and his eyes harden.
Now on the steps of the SOMEONE Memorial.
Nighttime. At the research base, SOMEONE and the young recruit sit in a rec room with a large window overlooking a courtyard.
She morphs into the shaggy-haired boy.
She transforms back.
He strides over to a fish tank.
As he sticks his head under water, gills appear on either side.
He opens his mouth and breathe
He grins at the others, then lifts his head out.
The shaggy-haired boy stares thoughtfully.
With puzzled looks, the others press their hands to their ear
SOMEONE smiles, then releases a gust of sound.
It hits the window and shatters it.
SOMEONE turns to the black-haired exotic dancer.
She shows her wing.
She spits a ball of fire, which soars out through the shattered window, and ignites the head of a statue in the courtyard.
She gives SOMEONE a nod.
He looks away.
SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a smile.
SOMEONE rises from his chair.
SOMEONE climbs out the broken window and enters the courtyard.
The others peer through the window at him.
They retreat behind the wall, then lean their bodies to look out the window again.
They remain in position.
Clenching his fists, he swivels his hips and shoulders.
Red rings of energy swirl around him and shoot off like discs.
One cuts the statue in half, leaving flames along the sever line.
Now in a meeting with SOMEONE.
Later at the research base.
through the window into the rec room, they see SOMEONE dancing on a couch.
Angel hovers in the air beside SOMEONE, who hangs upside-down from the ceiling.
SOMEONE wears scaly armor as SOMEONE slams him with a piece of metal.
With her hands on her hips, SOMEONE gapes at the rowdy youngster
SOMEONE and Angel stop dancing. SOMEONE flips down and SOMEONE's armor melts away.
She points at SOMEONE.
She grins at SOMEONE.
He gives the recruits a dry look. As he and SOMEONE leave, SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE.
SOMEONE stares dejectedly as he heads off.
Now our view drifts away from a mansion on a vast countryside estate.
Words appear: "Russian Military Retreat."
As a truck trundles down a road into a thick barrier of trees bordering the estate,
SOMEONE and SOMEONE ride in back.
Lifting a hatch, they peer into the cab, where SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE.
Craning his neck, SOMEONE looks down at the road and sees soldiers guarding a roadblock up ahead.
He faces soldiers in back with him.
They arrive at the roadblock and a soldier approaches.
A dog pulls a soldier toward the truck.
As SOMEONE heads to the back, the soldiers inside raise their gun
SOMEONE touches his temple.
The dog sniffs around the vehicle and SOMEONE leads a soldier to the truck's rear.
Throwing open its doors, he finds it empty. Standing among the soldiers with drawn weapons, SOMEONE keeps his fingers on his temple.
SOMEONE turns to the soldier
As he swings the doors closed, SOMEONE lowers his hand.
His shoulders sag in relief and SOMEONE pats his knee.
Later a view through binoculars shows a helicopter landing at the military retreat.
Hidden behind a hill, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE watch as SOMEONE climbs off the chopper and heads toward the mansion.
With puzzled looks, they lower their binocular
As he touches his temple, SOMEONE and SOMEONE raise their binoculars again.
SOMEONE's mind's eye zooms past a barbed-wire fence protecting the mansion
to a soldier standing guard at its portico.
The Russian man blinks as if dazed, then shifts his gaze to SOMEONE as she greets a mustached general.
The general escorts her inside and SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE.
The telepath frowns.
The violated Russian soldier gives a puzzled look.
He runs off.
Meanwhile in a bedroom, the general toasts with SOMEONE.
He drains his drink and SOMEONE sips her
They set down their glasses.
With a seductive look, she rises from a couch.
She undoes the belt on her dress.
She lowers her zipper, which trails from her collar to the hem of her skirt.
The general stares with hungry eyes.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE watch through binoculars as coils of the barbed-wire fence wrap around soldiers guarding it
and pull them to the ground.
SOMEONE directs a gate to lift and sprints underneath. As the guards by the portico aim their weapons,
SOMEONE extends his arms, drawing the soldiers toward him, then pulls his elbows down, causing them to fall.
He kicks one as he races past.
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE.
Now SOMEONE enters the mansion.
As two soldiers aim their weapons, he commands the guns to disassemble, then hurls them into the ground.
Outside, SOMEONE spots a soldier wrapped in barbed wire.
He hurries over.
He touches the soldier's cheek. Forget my face.
The Russian's eyes close and his head drops.
SOMEONE rushes to the mansion.
In the bedroom, the general sits on the bed, with SOMEONE straddling him.
The real SOMEONE watches from the couch.
Dressed in only her underwear, she nibbles a cracker.
Bursting into the room, SOMEONE and SOMEONE find the mustached general fondling his imaginary woman.
They exchange a look and SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
Coming out of his trance, the general glare.
As he reaches for his gun, SOMEONE points at him.
The general falls back and passes out.
Standing, SOMEONE morphs into her diamond form.
With his eyes fixed on her, SOMEONE touches his temple.
SOMEONE winces.
He glances at SOMEONE.
As SOMEONE sprints to the door, the men each grab an arm and wrestle her to the brass bed frame,
where they hold her against the foot board.
SOMEONE commands its bars to wrap around her wrists.
He bends the frame to hold her tighter.
His chest heaves. As SOMEONE struggles against her restraints, he directs a bar to wrap around her neck.
He commands two more and they each bind an arm just below the shoulder.
SOMEONE's brow creases in a pained look.
SOMEONE shakes his head.
Sucking in ragged breaths, he controls the bar around SOMEONE's neck,
making it squeeze even tighter.
SOMEONE's chest heaves.
The metal wrings SOMEONE's diamond skin, causing a crack around her neck.
As SOMEONE releases the bar strangling her, the captive morphs back into her human form.
He turns away.
He prepares himself a cracker.
Gazing intently at SOMEONE, SOMEONE touches his temple.
In her mind, he sees the United States on a world map.
The focus shifts as SOMEONE places a magnet of a missile on top of Cuba.
Warheads soar around a globe, launching from the United States and landing in Russia.
As they detonate, missiles fly from Russia to the US and explode.
A burst of fire gives way to a mushroom cloud.
Another vision shows the Capitol building now in ruins amid a destroyed cityscape.
SOMEONE lowers his hand, then turns to SOMEONE.
He shifts his gaze back to SOMEONE.
SOMEONE gives a troubled look.
Meanwhile, SOMEONE watches a score display as SOMEONE plays pinball in the rec room.
In the courtyard, two agents pass the window and look in at Angel, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE.
He mimes flying.
SOMEONE stands.
With a sarcastic salute, SOMEONE draws curtains over the window, then sits again.
SOMEONE lowers her thoughtful gaze.
She returns her eyes to Angel, who looks away.
The recruits glance around.
SOMEONE turns from the pinball machine.
As he strides to the window, SOMEONE follows.
The others rise from their seats.
SOMEONE opens the curtains. Meanwhile in the man in black's office,
As the man in black steps toward his window, SOMEONE materializes behind him,
grabs the subordinate agent, then disappears with him.
Reappearing, he grabs the supervising agent and teleports him into the sky above the base.
The recruits watch through the window as SOMEONE releases the man in black, then disappear
The portly agent plummets to the courtyard.
Now more CIA agents rain from the sky.
One crashes through a skylight in the rec room.
As SOMEONE enters the building wearing the helmet, an agent talks into a radio.
SOMEONE absorbs his bullets.
SOMEONE lifts him by the throat. Meanwhile,
the recruits watch through the window as SOMEONE appears in the courtyard.
The agents open fire, but SOMEONE disappears.
The mutant materializes next to an agent and forces him to fire into the room.
The young mutants see a cyclone pass by the transmitter. In the main atrium, the agent dangles in SOMEONE's grasp.
A team of soldiers surrounding him cock their weapons. SOMEONE launches his captive into the air and the team fires.
As he absorbs the bullets,
SOMEONE's arms appear to split at the elbow, replicate into three forearms, then rejoin.
A soldier fires a rocket launcher. Flames engulf the SOMEONE, then shrink into his hands as he absorbs the energy.
Meanwhile, the recruits watches SOMEONE slay agents in the courtyard.
SOMEONE spears a man in the chest with his devil's tail.
As the recruits race down a hall, soldiers stop them.
In the atrium, SOMEONE stomps his foot and a glowing pulse of energy cracks the floor underneath.
It spreads to the wall, then surges around the room
taking out the balcony and the soldiers along with it.
In the hallway, the recruits and soldiers duck.
Standing at the atrium's center, SOMEONE directs the roiling flames with his gaze
and the recruits retreat down the hall.
Racing into a small lunch room, they see the cyclone through a window.
The swirling wind engulfs the transmitter, ripping it apart.
The recruits turn to the other window and find SOMEONE slaying soldiers and agents. Strangling a man with his tail, he uses him as a shield against an agent with a gun.
The agent accidentally shoots SOMEONE's hostage and the teleporter vanishes.
The cyclone outside hurls a man into the window and shatters it.
At the other window, SOMEONE appears in front of a trembling agent.
The mutant easily dispatches him, stabbing him in the back.
The cyclone-maker climbs through the broken window.
The recruits turn to see SOMEONE coming in from the other side.
The door open
SOMEONE steps in and faces the huddle of terrified young recruit
He removes the anti-telepathy helmet.
Outside, a soldier aims.
The devilish mutant materializes in the courtyard and kills him with a sword.
He faces SOMEONE pointedly.
SOMEONE looks away.
SOMEONE's gaze falls on Angel and grows seductively tender.
With a vulnerable pout, the young woman swallows and looks down at his extended hand.
She accepts it and SOMEONE leads her to the shattered window.
SOMEONE reaches out to her, but she turns away and continues out with SOMEONE.
The young man lowers his arm as she steps through the window with SOMEONE and the cyclone-maker.
SOMEONE lowers his woeful gaze.
He sighs heavily and his expression grows resolute.
He faces SOMEONE who scowls as SOMEONE speaks. The young men trade angry shove
As he comes outside, Angel smirks. SOMEONE smiles and meets him.
Behind him, the other young mutants form a line.

Angel stares sadly at her friend as SOMEONE and his team join hands, then disappear with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE convulses, his form turning metallic.
It takes on the appearance of volcanic rock
with lava beneath the surface.
SOMEONE steadies himself and becomes stone,
appearing to subdue the combustion of his body.
He faces SOMEONE, whose eyes widen.
SOMEONE reaches out to him, resuming his flesh-and-blood form.
Brilliant light shines out through cracks in his skin.
It consumes him, then overwhelms our view.
In Moscow, the Russian general looks out at a military parade through from a balcony. He goes inside.
He shakes SOMEONE's hand.
Once again, my sympathies for your treatment at the hands of the CIA.
These Americans are ruthless.
Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey.
He arrives at a world map highlighting the United States and Soviet Union, then points out the strategic location.
He plants a missile-shaped crimson marker over a sizable island southeast of the Floridian coast.
He steps in close to SOMEONE and removes the marker.
The general stares at him.
He marches to a phone on one of the long tables and picks it up.
SOMEONE, Angel, and the cyclone-maker appear before him.
He fearfully lowers the phone, then looks back at SOMEONE.
The evil mutant leader smiles and holds out his hands.
The general faces SOMEONE's menacing team.
Now a black car arrives outside the devastated research facility.
SOMEONE and SOMEONE rush out.
They find the remaining teens on a bench.
As SOMEONE embraces his adopted sister, SOMEONE joins the group.
SOMEONE hangs his head and SOMEONE looks away.
All eyes turn on SOMEONE.
SOMEONE takes him aside.
SOMEONE faces the group, his angular features set in a grim frown.
SOMEONE yields a faint comforting smile.
Now SOMEONE sits in a small room.
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from an observation room,
SOMEONE stands and strides confidently to the window.
Her finger crystallizes and she uses it to cut a circle in the glass.
The mutant lightly taps it and it drops out of the window.
Now a massive Russian ship, named Aral Sea, slowly moves across the ocean.
The captain and a few crew members stand vigilantly on the control bridge.
Captain, no sign of any American ships.
Maintain course. Full ahead.
At the Pentagon.
Around the ring-shaped table, officials raise their hands unanimously.
Now on the Xavier estate's verdant grounds.
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the teens stare up at the palatial manor house.
SOMEONE gratefully kisses SOMEONE's blonde head.
She leads the group off a gravel driveway and around the side of the mansion.
Now words appear beneath a gray, overcast public square.
Moscow, Russia. In the Soviet war room.
Dear comrades, the United States have dispatched warships for Cuba.
This leaves us no choice.
The general circles the packed room, indicating the map with a long pointer.
He halts before a central table.
Comrade First Secretary, we must send in our fleet.
A bald man whispers with two colleagues on either side of him, then gives a nod.
Dispatch the fleet.
The scene freezes in a photo.
Panels featuring newsreels and headlines fill the screen.
Blossoming mushroom clouds fill the panels, which vanish.
The remaining two converge to reveal SOMEONE aiming a gun on his estate.
His hand shakes as he cocks it.
SOMEONE stands before him, the gun pointed at his head.
SOMEONE takes a deep breath as his companion grins eagerly.
He takes the gun.
Now in a long arched chamber,
SOMEONE sets up a mannequin.
Now outside, SOMEONE shatters panes of glass.
Now SOMEONE runs laps with SOMEONE.
In the bunker.
SOMEONE steps out and closes a heavy-duty hatch.
He presses an ear to the door.
Opening it, he finds the bunker's arch-shaped support beams in flames.
He grabs an extinguisher and hurriedly puts out the fire.
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE fit SOMEONE with cloth-wing attachments.
At a window.
Sitting on the window's ledge, SOMEONE crosses himself, then spreads his wings.
He pitches off the window.
He plummets.
Now SOMEONE stands with SOMEONE.
SOMEONE stretches his bare feet.
They race down the driveway.
SOMEONE pulls in front, then disappears ahead of SOMEONE, who pumps his arms as he sprints.
In a blur of motion, SOMEONE appears behind SOMEONE, then catches up and taps his shoulder.
Stopping, SOMEONE shakes his head.
SOMEONE saunters over.
He slaps his back.
SOMEONE trudges away.
Passing a window, he sees SOMEONE inside.
She waves and he gives her a half-hearted smile as he returns the gesture.
Now as SOMEONE does bench presses, the barbell lifts out of her hands.
He releases the barbell.
SOMEONE morphs into her true form as she catches it.
SOMEONE stares after him as he strides away.
Now SOMEONE wears a vest with a circular panel on its chest.
Facing three mannequins, SOMEONE shoots a shaft of energy from his chest.
He destroys the one on the left.
He tries again and the blast knocks him over.
Only the middle mannequin remains standing. Later SOMEONE joins SOMEONE in a lab.
Sitting on his lap, SOMEONE peers into his microscope.
Now on top of a giant satellite dish.
SOMEONE closes his mouth.
SOMEONE shoves SOMEONE off the dish.
The shaggy-haired boy plummets toward some trees.
Rings of sound waves shoot out of his mouth, expanding in a cone shape.
They propel SOMEONE high into the air.
The boy dives back toward the satellite dish, then uses his sound rings to glide over dish's concave face.
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a disapproving look.
SOMEONE marks a mannequin with an X.
SOMEONE stands by the dummy.
On the mannequin's other side, SOMEONE inches away from the target.
SOMEONE shoots energy from his chest and the beam hits the dummy in a burst of flames.
Unharmed, SOMEONE and SOMEONE move aside. SOMEONE faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE's grin fades.
Now SOMEONE points at the satellite dish in the far distance.
SOMEONE stare
He shoots an uncertain look and his friend nod
SOMEONE's shoulders heave.
With his fingers spread wide, he aims his palms at the dish.
It remains motionless.
SOMEONE's hands tremble and his face flushes.
Lowering his arms, he drops his head.
Raising his fingers, he wiggles them questioningly.
SOMEONE shakes his head and SOMEONE touches his temple.
His eyes close briefly, then meet SOMEONE's.
The landscape around the brooding man blur
In his mind's eye, SOMEONE sees a young SOMEONE lighting candle
His mother stands with him and they share a smile.
Reaching out, she brushes his cheek with her finger.
As the memory fades, SOMEONE blinks out a tear.
He stares off, his chest heaving, then clenches his
SOMEONE opens his eyes and brushes a tear from his own cheek.
He hold SOMEONE's gaze.
He pats him on the shoulder.
SOMEONE faces the satellite dish.
He bows his head for a moment, then extends his hand and fingers as if stretching to reach the dish.
The dish shifts and SOMEONE knits his brow in concentration.
His hand trembles.
SOMEONE's shoulders heave as he controls the satellite dish, his face pulled into an expression of both sadness and triumph.
He curls his fingers as if holding an invisible tennis ball,
then turns his hand,
rotating the dish toward the mansion.
Breaking into a grin, he lowers his arm.
SOMEONE sticks her head out a window.
Now the group watches a TV.
Now as the Russian cargo ship glides over the ocean, SOMEONE's sub follows underwater.
SOMEONE watches the news.
Beside him, Angel twitches a smile, then clinks her glass with SOMEONE's.
Meanwhile in SOMEONE's room, SOMEONE enter.
SOMEONE beams at him.
He holds out a case.
Grinning, SOMEONE opens it and finds two syringes with needles inside.
Her smile fades and she sits.
SOMEONE sits across from her.
SOMEONE stares with a conflicted gaze.
She leans toward him.
With a determined smile, he takes one of the shots from the case.
He taps the syringe's barrel, then prepares to inject.
He gives her a puzzled look.
SOMEONE's face falls and he glances away.
She stares into his eye
Her eyes turn yellow.
Her skin becomes blue and her hair morphs into its original color.
SOMEONE gazes at her.
Changing back into the blonde teen, SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a heartbroken look.
He nods.
She averts her outraged gaze.
Holding up the shot, he gives a firm nod, then stands and heads out of the room.
SOMEONE's betrayed eyes narrow as she watches him leave.
Lowering her gaze to the case, she removes its remaining injection, and stares at the lime-green serum in the syringe's barrel.
Now in a study, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit across from each other,
their eyes fixed on a chess game between them.
SOMEONE rests his hand on his fist while SOMEONE sips a martini.
SOMEONE sits back.
SOMEONE lifts his gaze to his and frown
SOMEONE captures one of his friend's chess pieces
Leaning his elbows on his knees, SOMEONE folds his hand
SOMEONE stares at the floor.
He looks at SOMEONE.
He holds the vengeful man's gaze.
SOMEONE gives a cool look.
Now sitting in the lab, SOMEONE taps a syringe,
then holds his thumb over its plunger.
He glances over his shoulder, then looks at the finger-like toes of his right foot.
Steeling himself, the bespectacled young man takes a breath.
Bending down, he injects himself near the ankle and presses down on the plunger.
He removes the syringe and sits up, keeping his eyes fixed on his foot.
The mutated appendage shrinks,
forming the shape of an average human foot.
SOMEONE wiggles his normal-looking toes.
Studying his new foot, the young man smiles, teary-eyed.
He glances aside, then looks at his right foot again.
The knuckles expand and the toes elongate.
SOMEONE shakes his head.
As the foot grows long and wide, things protrude from under the skin, which turns blue.
Clutching his leg, SOMEONE grits his teeth.
Things protrude on his mutating hands as well.
As he clutches at his pant leg, it rises, revealing a thick coat of blue hair.
His hand balloons in size and lands on a lamp table.
Growing blue and furry, the giant arm topples the table.
Reflected in a glass sphere, SOMEONE's human face morphs into that of a monster.
Now SOMEONE steps through a door and stops with a slight smile.
He shuts the door behind him.
SOMEONE lies in his bed.
He crosses the room. SOMEONE turns on her side and shape-shifts.
