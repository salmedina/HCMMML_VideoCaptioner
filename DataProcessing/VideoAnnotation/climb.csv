ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS608.avi	240	281	The vampire falls aside revealing SOMEONE standing halfway through a hatch, his modified ax in hand. SOMEONE spots a vampire climbing on to the roof. He grabs his partner's weapon and attacks the new arrival knocking the monster over the edge. He tosses the ax back to SOMEONE who chops into another. With SOMEONE's blade stuck in his fallen foe, a vampire attacks with kicks and punches. As SOMEONE fends off the attacker, SOMEONE lifts his ax, twirls it, releasing a spray of blood, then slashes off the vampire's head. In the same swing, he strikes another vampire's midsection. He massacres another, slashing his face several times, then passes the ax to SOMEONE. SOMEONE takes out two vampires then twirls the ax behind his back to SOMEONE who spins the versatile weapon and strikes another vampire with its butt. Through a veil of wind-swept steam, SOMEONE vanquishes yet another vampire. He brings his ax down once more.
